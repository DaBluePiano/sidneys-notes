The soft hum of my laptop had been mny constant compaion for the past three hours, a stady background noise as I pounded away at the keyboard. The assignment was due at midnight, and I had finally reached the last paragraph. Relief washed over me as I reread my work, a sense of accomplishment settling in. Just a few more sentences, a quick proofread, and I could submit it.

Then without warning, the screen flickered. The cursor froze. My fingers howevered above the keys, bmy breath catching in my throat.

"No, no, no, no" I muttered, my heartbeat quickening.

I jabbed at the power button. Nothing. The screen went black.

Panic set in. My mind raced through the possibilities. A dead battery? No, the charger was plugged in. A system crash? Maybe. But this couldn't be happening - not now, not when I was so close to finishing.

Frantically, I pressed pbuttons, hoping for a miracle. When none came, I scrambled for my phone, my hands shaking as I searched for solutions. A hard reset, maybe? I tried. Still nothing. The screen remained lifeless, an unresponsive voice where my heard work had once existed.

My stomach churned as I realised the worst part: I hadn't saved the lastest version of my document. Hours of research, meticulous structuring, and areful phrasing - all gone in an instant.

A wave of frustration crashed over me. I wanted to screm, to cry, to throw the laptop out of the window. But i had not time for that. It was eleven thirty. I needed to act fast.

Snatching up a pen and paper, I scribbled down everything I could remember, my mind scrambling to reconstruct the lost paragraphs. My handwriting was messy, my sentences disjointed, but I had no choice. With fifteen minutes to spare, I opened an old, sluggish family computer and began typing furiously. Each second felt like an eternity.

At eleven fifty-eight, I clicked *Submit*.

I exhaled, my body slumping in exhaustion. The disaster had been averted - barely. But as I stared at my lifeless laptop, I made a solemn vow: I would never, ever, forget to save my work again.
