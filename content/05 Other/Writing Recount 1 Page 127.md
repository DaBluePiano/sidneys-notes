The Meetings
The event that you must base your recount on is THE MEETING. Your recount might be about them eting between a first-time surfer and a great white shark, a meting between two boys in a pie-eating competition or a meeting between an adopted child and his or her birth mother. It could be about a meeting at the United Nations to discuss the end of the world or meeting yourself for the first time after suffering amnesia for fifteen years. 

I had never considered competitive eating as a sport, but when my best friend dared me to enter the annual pie-eating competition, I couldn’t say no. It was a small-town event with a big reputation. Legends had been made here. And today, I was about to meet one of them.

As I took my seat at the long table covered in glistening blueberry pies, I glanced to my right and almost dropped my spoon. Seated next to me was none other than _Tommy "The Tornado" Thompson_, the undefeated champion of the past five years. He was famous for inhaling pies at speeds that defied the laws of physics.

“Hey, rookie,” Tommy said with a smirk, stretching his fingers like an athlete warming up for a marathon. “Hope you didn’t eat breakfast.”

I swallowed hard. I had eaten breakfast. And lunch. And possibly a snack. My stomach was already having second thoughts about this decision.

The referee blew the whistle, and chaos erupted. Tommy attacked his first pie like a blender set to high speed. I, on the other hand, managed a single, dignified bite before my face was assaulted by an explosion of blueberry filling from my overeager neighbor.

“Keep up, rookie!” Tommy taunted, barely stopping to breathe.

Determined, I shoved more pie into my mouth, but it quickly became clear that I was out of my league. My strategy of “chew and swallow” was no match for Tommy’s “dislocate jaw and absorb.” Halfway through, my stomach waved a white flag.

Then, just when all hope was lost, disaster struck—the ultimate betrayal. Tommy hiccupped. Then he hiccupped again. And again. His rhythm broke, his momentum faltered, and his face turned the color of an overripe tomato.

“Hiccup—wait—hiccup—nooo!” he groaned, slumping over his half-eaten pie.

Seizing my chance, I powered through one final mouthful and raised my hands in victory just as the whistle blew.

The crowd erupted. I had won. Sure, it was mostly thanks to Tommy’s unexpected bout of hiccups, but a win was a win. As they handed me the trophy (a golden pie tin), Tommy gave me a nod of respect.

“Not bad, rookie,” he said. “Next year, though, you’re going down.”

I grinned, wiping blueberry off my chin. “We’ll see, Tornado. We’ll see.”
