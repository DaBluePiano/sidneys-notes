The idea that you must base your recount on is CELEBRATION. Your recount might be about celebrating something simple and everyday, such as passing a test or turning thirteen. It could be about something more significant such as graduating from university or celebrating an event such as Christmas or Easter.

I had never considered myself a fan of surprises, but when my best friend convinced me to celebrate my birthday with a surprise party, I couldn’t say no. It was a small gathering with a big reputation. Legends had been made at our birthday parties. And today, I was about to meet one of them.

As I walked into my house, I glanced around and almost dropped my phone. Seated in my living room was none other than *Grandpa "The Prankster" Thompson*, the undefeated champion of birthday surprises for the past five years. He was famous for orchestrating pranks that defied the laws of common sense.

“Hey, birthday kid,” Grandpa said with a smirk, stretching his fingers like a magician preparing for his grand act. “Hope you didn’t expect a normal party.”

I swallowed hard. I had expected cake. And balloons. And possibly a few harmless jokes. My nerves were already having second thoughts about this decision.

The lights dimmed, and chaos erupted. Grandpa’s prank plans went into full effect. Confetti cannons exploded unexpectedly, a whoopee cushion symphony played under unsuspecting guests, and someone—most likely Grandpa—had swapped out my birthday cake for a mound of mashed potatoes topped with candles.

“Keep up, birthday kid!” Grandpa taunted, barely stopping to chuckle.

Determined, I played along, but it quickly became clear that I was outmatched. My strategy of “enjoy the party” was no match for Grandpa’s “mastermind of mayhem.” Halfway through, my stomach ached from laughing too much.

Then, just when all hope for a normal birthday was lost, disaster struck—the ultimate betrayal. Grandpa hiccupped. Then he hiccupped again. And again. His rhythm broke, his momentum faltered, and his face turned the color of an overripe tomato.

“Hiccup—wait—hiccup—nooo!” he groaned, slumping over the pile of mashed potatoes.

Seizing my chance, I grabbed the backup cake my mom had wisely prepared and raised my hands in victory just as the birthday song began.

The crowd erupted. I had survived. Sure, it was mostly thanks to Grandpa’s unexpected bout of hiccups, but a win was a win. As they handed me my slice of cake, Grandpa gave me a nod of respect.

“Not bad, birthday kid,” he said. “Next year, though, you’re going down.”

I grinned, wiping frosting off my chin. “We’ll see, Prankster. We’ll see.”
