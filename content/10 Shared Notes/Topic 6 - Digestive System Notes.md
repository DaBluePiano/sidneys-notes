# 2 Levels of Organisation of Living Things
There are in all four levels of organisation of living things. The levels or organisation of living thins in sequence are the cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.
Cells -> tissues -> organs -> (organ) systems -> Organism
## 2.1 Cell
The **cell** is considered to be the basic unit of life. It is also known as the building block of life. A cell is bound by the cell membrane and has a nucleus which acts as the brain of the cell.

> [!Example] Examples of Cells
> Muscle Cell
> Nerve Cell
> Red Blood Cell
> Skin Cell
> etc.

### 2.1.1 Anatomy of Human Cells
![[anatomy-human-cells-27447134.webp]]

## 2.2 Tissue
The **tissues** are a collection of cells which perform specialized functions. E.g. the cells in the heart, liver cells etc.

> [!Example] Examples of Tissue
> Skin Tissue
> Cardiac Tissue
> etc.

## 2.3 Organ
The various **organs** of animals include the lungs, brain, liver, etc. Roots, stem and leaves, etc. are different organs of the plants.

> [!Example] Examples of Organs
> Stomach
> Heart
> Lungs

## 2.4 Organ System
The **organ systems** are complex mechanisms which carry out important functions of the body. For example, the circulatory system in animals and vascular system in plants.

> [!Example] Examples of Organ systems
> Digestive System
> Skeletal System
> etc.

## 2.5 Organism
Amongst the different levels of organization of living things, this is the highest level. An **organism** could either be unicellular or multicellular. The organisms that are closely related are grouped together under a single species.

> [!Example] Examples of Organisms
> Humans
> Dogs
> Cats
> etc.





# 3 The Digestive System
> [!Definition] What is the Digestive System?
> The human digestive system is a complex series of organs and glands that processes food. In order to use the food we eat, our body has to break the food down into smaller molecules that it can process; it also has to excrete waste. The digestive system is essentially a long, twisting tube that runs from the mouth to the anus, plus a few other organs (like the liver and pancreas) that produce or store digestive chemicals.

# 4 Mechanical and Chemical Digestion
## 4.1 Mechanical Digestion
Mechanical digestion: refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can then be further broken down by digestive enzymes, e.g. the teeth cutting and grinding food. 

## 4.2 Chemical Digestion
Chemical digestion: where enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use.

### 4.2.1 Enzymes

> [!Summary] The purpose of Enzymes
> - The purpose of an enzyme in a cell is to allow the cell to carry out chemical reactions very quickly. These reactions allow the cell to build thing or take things apart as needed.

- At the most basic level, a cell is really a little bag full of chemical reactions that are made possible by enzymes.
- Enzymes are made from **amino acids**, and they are proteins.

#### 4.2.1.1 Enzymes in the Digestive System
Enzymes are what the body uses to break down food items. Without enzymes, no food would get broken down or absorbed into the bloodstream.
It is the bloodstream that carries nutrients to every single cell in the body and the nutrients are the only thing that keeps the cells alive.
Enzymes are sort of the 'key' to getting all our nutrients back out of the food we eat. Without this 'key' our bodies would not be able to live. Water helps clean the stomach and helps digestion. Other fluids do not replace water as a digestive aid. Anything added to the water at all changes the function it has in the digestive system.
## 4.3 The Digestive Process
The digestive process is as follows
The Mouth -> The Esophagus -> The Stomach -> The Small Intestine -> The Large Intestine -> The End (Anus)
### 4.3.1 The Mouth
Food is partly broken down by the process of chewing and by the chemical action of salivary enzymes.

### 4.3.2 The Esophagus
After being chewed the food enters the esophagus. It uses wave-like muscles movements to force food from the throat into the stomach. This muscle movement gives us the ability to eat or drunk even when we're upside-down.

### 4.3.3 The Stomach
The stomach is a large, sack-like organ that churns the food and bathes it in a very strong acid (gastric acid).

### 4.3.4 The Small Intestine
After being in the stomach, food enters the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. In the small intestine, bile pancreatic enzymes, and other digestive enzymes produced by the inner wall of the small intestine help in the breakdown of food

### 4.3.5 The Large Intestine
 After passing through the small intestine, food passes into the large intestine. In the large intestine, some of the water and electrolytes are removed from the food. Many microbes in the large intestine help in the digestion process. 

### 4.3.6 The End
Solid waste is then stored in the rectum until it i excreted via the anus.

# 5 Villi
The absorption of most of the nutrients into your body occurs in the last section of the small intestine. The finger-like villi on the walls give it a large surface area that speeds up nutrient absorption. Many tiny blood vessels called capillaries transport the nutrients from the villi into your bloodstream. Undigested food passes into the large intestine where water and vitamins may be removed.

# 6 Parts of the Digestive System
## 6.1 Mouth
Breaks down food into small pieces and mixes it with saliva 
## 6.2 Liver
Produces bile and processes nutrients obtained from food 

## 6.3 Gall Bladder
Stores bile 

## 6.4 Rectum
Stores the waste until it leaves the body through the anus 

## 6.5 Esophagus 
Is a muscular tube down which food travels from the mouth to the stomach secretes juices that get digestion under way pancreas secretes enzymes into the small intestine 

## 6.6 Small intestine 
Is the main site where food is digested 

## 6.7 Large intestine
Absorbs water from digestive waste 
## 6.8 Anus
# 7 Teeth
Teeth come in four main types: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Each is shaped for a specific function. People have two sets of teeth during their lives: the 20 milk teeth emerge between the ages of about six months and three years. The 32 permanent teeth emerge from the age of about six years into the early twenties.

# 8 Nutritional Requirements
## 8.1 Human Dietary Needs
The human diet must provide the following: 
- **calories**; enough to meet our daily energy needs. 
- **amino acids**; There are nine, or so, "essential" amino acids that we need for protein synthesis.
- **fatty acids**; There are three "essential" fatty acids. 
- **minerals**; We need 18 different minerals, eg. Calcium in large amounts and zinc in small amounts. 
- **vitamins**; There is about a dozen different vitamins that our bodies require. Eg. Vitamin C.

# 9 Nutritional Diseases
Nutritional diseases in humans are disorders caused by an imbalance in nutrition. There are nutritional diseases caused by a lack of nutrients, while others that have excess nutrients. Other nutritional diseases are the result of poisonous components in foods. Nutritional diseases can result in death.
# 10 Nutritional Tips
## 10.1 Sodium
- Sodium is found in salt and is naturally occurring in some foods. While we do need small amounts of sodium for good health, too much salt is linked to increased risk of high blood pressure, which can increase your risk of cardiovascular (heart) and kidney disease. 
- Avoid adding salt to food when cooking and eating, and read labels to choose foods that have less than 120mg of sodium per 100g.
## 10.2 Sugar
Consuming a lot of added sugars, especially from foods like lollies, chocolate, cakes, biscuits, desserts and soft drink, can add extra kilojoules to your diet. 
- This can lead to weight gain and increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. 
- Too much sugar can also cause dental cavities. 
- Most fruits, vegetables, legumes and unsweetened dairy foods contain small amounts of naturally- occurring sugars which are not harmful.
## 10.3 Hygiene
**Hygiene** refers to conditions and practices that help to maintain health and prevent the spread of diseases. Basic personal hygiene practices:
- Washing yourself in a shower or a bath every day and changing into clean clothes. 
- Cleaning the teeth at least once a day. 
- Washing hands with soap after going to the toilet .
- Washing hands with soap before preparing and/or eating food. 
- Turning away from other people and covering the nose and mouth with a tissue or the hand when coughing or sneezing.
## 10.4 Bacteria
- Bacteria are micro-organisms (tiny living things). 
- Bacteria come in different shapes. Round bacteria are called coccus. Rod shaped are called bacillus. Spiral are called spirillum. Comma shaped, vibrio. 
- Bacteria are found on the human body, in soil, in oceans and rivers. On the food we eat and on objects that we touch. 
- Some bacteria are good and for example help us digest our food. 
- Other bacteria can make us very sick.
