# Movement of People

## 🧭 Migration, 1750–1901: Causes & Effects

### 🔄 What Is Migration?

- **Migration** = movement of people, either within or between countries.
- **Emigration** = leaving one’s homeland.
- **Immigration** = arriving to settle in a new country.

### 👥 Types of Migrants

- **Convict**: Forced to migrate due to criminal punishment.
- **Slave**: Forced to migrate as property with no rights.
- **Free settler**: Voluntarily migrates and pays own way.
- **Assisted migrant**: Given financial support to migrate.

---

## 🌍 Causes of Migration

### 🔺 Push Factors (negative Reasons to leave)

- Poverty, unemployment, crime, famine, crop failure.
- War, political or religious persecution.
- Overcrowded cities, poor living/working conditions.
- Natural disasters (e.g. Irish Potato Famine).
- Technological job losses (e.g. in agriculture).

### 🔻 Pull Factors (positive Reasons to Go Somewhere else)

- Promises of jobs, land, gold, wealth.
- More space and freedom (religious, political).
- Opportunity to escape crime or poverty.
- Propaganda encouraging emigration (e.g. British posters promoting Australia).

---

## 🌱 Agricultural Revolution (1700s–1800s)

### ⚙️ Key Changes:

- Introduction of **crop rotation**, better **animal breeding**, and **machinery** like Jethro Tull’s seed drill.
- **Enclosure**: Common land was fenced off and turned private, evicting peasants.
    - Peasants lost access to subsistence farming.
    - Landowners benefited; poor forced into cities.

### 🔥 Historical Debate (Contestability)

- **Marxist view**: Enclosure = class theft by rich, creating a landless working class.
- **Alternative view**: Helped end rural poverty by promoting efficiency.

---

## 🏭 Industrial Revolution (c. 1750–1901)

### 🇬🇧 Why Britain?

- Coal and iron deposits.
- Capital from banks, stock markets.
- Political stability + patent laws.
- Surplus labour from agricultural changes.
- Global markets via British Empire.

### ⚒️ Key Inventions

- **Textile industry**: Flying shuttle, spinning jenny, water frame, power loom.
- **Steam engine**: Perfected by James Watt; used in factories, mines, ships, trains.
- **Iron/coal production**: Smelting with coke = more output.

---

## 🚂 Changes Brought by Industrialisation

### Urbanisation

- Cities (Manchester, Liverpool) grew rapidly.
- Crowded slums, pollution, disease.

### Working Conditions

- 12–16 hour shifts.
- Low wages (especially for women and children).
- Dangerous jobs (e.g. cleaning machines while running).
- Child labour: exploited for small size; harsh punishments.
- Factory fines, physical punishments, and health risks (cotton dust = lung disease).

### Reforms

- **1833 Factory Act**: Limited children’s hours, enforced inspections.
- **1842 Mines Act**: Banned women/children in mines.
- **1847 Ten Hours Act**: Limited women/children to 10-hour days.

---

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Impacts on People

### Men, Women, Children

- Children: exploited, sometimes sold to chimney sweeps.
- Women: worked in mines, wet conditions, often pregnant.
- Men: low pay, faced unemployment as machines replaced workers.
- Life in industrial cities = unsanitary, crowded, disease-ridden.

### Reformers

- **Robert Owen**: Built model factories (light, toilets, no child labour under 10).
- Supported unions and better working conditions.
- **Friedrich Engels**: Wrote about horrific conditions in Manchester (1845).

---

## ⛓️ Slavery and the Industrial Revolution

### The Slave Trade

- Triangle Trade: Goods → Africa; Slaves → Americas; Sugar/cotton → Europe.
- 60,000+ slaves per year by 18th century.

### Impact on Industry

- Slave-produced goods (cotton, sugar, tobacco) powered British industry.
- Steam tech increased slave labour efficiency (e.g. Cuba's sugar mills).
- Abolished in Britain in 1807, but profits continued.

### Legacy

- Riches from slavery funded British banks, railways, and factories (e.g. Barclays, Manchester “Cottonopolis”).

---

## 🚢 Convict Transportation

### Britain’s Response to Crime & Overcrowding

- Over 200 crimes punishable by death (e.g. theft, forgery).
- Prisons overcrowded → prisoners held in hulks (floating jails).
- Sent convicts to:

    1. North America (until 1783).
    2. West Africa (briefly).
    3. **Australia (from 1788)**.

### Who Were the Convicts?

- Mostly poor, unskilled, often repeat offenders.
- 30% under 19 years old.
- Crimes: pick-pocketing, sheep theft, burglary.

### Political Prisoners

- Chartists, Luddites, unionists (e.g. Tolpuddle Martyrs).
- Many stayed after serving their sentence and prospered.

---

## 🌏 Free Settlers

- Migrated voluntarily, often pushed by hardship and pulled by opportunity.
- Received **land grants**, often used **convict labour**.
- By 1830s–50s, 200,000+ free settlers moved to Australia.

### Assisted Migration

- Governments helped skilled workers move to colonies.
- Boosted population and labour force.

---

## 🥇 Gold Rushes

### USA

- **California (1848)**: 300,000 people came.
- **Colorado (1859)**: Boosted development of inland areas.

### Australia

- **Bathurst, NSW (1851)**: population boomed from 400,000 to 1.1 million in 10 years.
- Attracted Chartists, political refugees.
- Seen as a land of freedom and opportunity.

## 🇦🇺 Impacts of European Settlement on Aboriginal People

### Dispossession

- 1788: First Fleet arrived at **Gadigal** land (part of **Eora Nation**).
- British took land, cut down trees, stole food, desecrated sites.
- Competition for water and food.
- **Smallpox, measles**, and other European diseases devastated Aboriginal populations.

### First Contact

- Early interactions included gift-giving and dancing.
- Initial goodwill faded as settlers expanded.

## ⚖️ Short- and Long-Term Impacts of Industrial Revolution

### Short-Term:

- Misery for workers.
- Exploitation of women/children.
- Urban pollution, slums, diseases.

### Long-Term:

- Urbanisation and globalisation.
- Better standard of living (eventually).
- Labour unions, reforms, modern society.
- Worldwide impact: new tech, global trade, communication.

# 🌍 World War I

   - **German Ambitions**: *Weltpolitik* aimed at expanding colonial and naval power.

2. **Militarism** 🛡️:
   - **Arms Race**:
     - **Naval**: Germany’s *Tirpitz Plan* (1900) challenged British naval dominance (e.g., HMS *Dreadnought* launched in 1906).
     - **Army Expansions**:
       - Germany: 1.3M troops (1880) → 5M (1914).
       - France: 0.73M → 4M.
   - **War Plans**: Germany’s Schlieffen Plan (quick defeat of France before Russia mobilizes).

3. **Alliances** 🤝:
   - **Triple Entente** (1907):
     - Britain, France, Russia (informal "understanding").
   - **Triple Alliance** (1882):

5. **Assassination** 🔫:
   - **Archduke Franz Ferdinand** killed in Sarajevo (28 June 1914) by Gavrilo Princip, a member of *Young Bosnia* (supported by Serbian Black Hand).
   - **July Crisis**:
     - Austria-Hungary’s ultimatum to Serbia (23 July) → Serbia’s partial refusal → Austria declares war (28 July).
     - Russia mobilizes → Germany declares war on Russia (1 August) and France (3 August).
     - **Schlieffen Plan**: Germany invades Belgium → Britain declares war (4 August).
