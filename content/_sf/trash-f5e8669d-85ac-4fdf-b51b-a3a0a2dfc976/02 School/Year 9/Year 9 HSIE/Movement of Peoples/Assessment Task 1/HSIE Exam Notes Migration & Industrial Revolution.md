# HSIE Exam Notes: Migration & Industrial Revolution (1750–1901)

---

## Migration: Causes, Types, and Impacts

### Push Factors (Reasons People Left)

1. **Economic Hardships**
   - **Enclosure Acts**:
     - Privatized common land (previously used for subsistence farming).
     - Displaced rural peasants (e.g., English villagers forced off ancestral lands).
   - **Agricultural Revolution**:
     - Mechanization (seed drills, crop rotation) reduced labor demand.
     - Example: Jethro Tull’s seed drill (1701) cut labor needs by 75%.
   - **Industrialization**:
     - Factories replaced cottage industries; low wages (e.g., children earned 3 shillings/week).

2. **Environmental Disasters**
   - **Irish Potato Famine (1845–52)**:
     - Potato blight destroyed crops; 1M deaths, 2M emigrated.
     - Landlords exported grain → starvation; "coffin ships" had 20% mortality.

3. **Political/Social Oppression**
   - **Persecution**:
     - Chartists (demanded voting rights) and Luddites (destroyed machinery) exiled.
     - Jewish communities fled pogroms in Eastern Europe.
   - **Crime and Punishment**:
     - Poverty-driven theft led to transportation (e.g., 165k+ convicts to Australia).

### Pull Factors (Reasons People Migrated)

1. **Economic Opportunities**
   - **Gold Rushes**:
     - California (1848): 300k migrants, including Chinese laborers.
     - Australia (1851): Population tripled (405k → 1.1M by 1860); Eureka Rebellion (1854) against license fees.
   - **Land Grants**:
     - Canada’s Canadian Pacific Railway (1880s): Free land for settlers.
     - Australia: Squatters claimed fertile land; selectors given poor plots.

2. **Political/Religious Freedom**
   - Puritans fled England for American colonies.
   - Australia marketed as a "land of opportunity" with democratic ideals.

## Key Migrant Groups

### 1. Convicts (1788–1868)

- **Crimes**: Petty theft (60%), sheep/horse stealing, political offenses.
- **Transportation Process**:
  - Held in rotting prison hulks before shipment.
  - Voyages lasted 6–8 months; high mortality from disease.
- **Life in Colonies**:
  - Built infrastructure (roads, buildings); some became landowners post-sentence.
  - Example: Francis Greenway (convict architect) designed Sydney’s Hyde Park Barracks.

### 2. Slaves (16th–19th Centuries)

- **Transatlantic Slave Trade**:
  - 12M+ Africans transported; 15–20% died during the Middle Passage.
  - **Triangular Trade**:
    - Leg 1: Europe → Africa (guns, cloth).
    - Leg 2 (Middle Passage): Africa → Americas (enslaved people).
    - Leg 3: Americas → Europe (sugar, cotton).
- **Plantation Life**:
  - 18-hour shifts in Cuban sugar mills; children sold separately from parents.
  - Punishments: Whippings, iron collars, forced breeding.

### 3. Free Settlers

- **Australia**:
  - **Squatters**: Wealthy pastoralists (e.g., Australian Agricultural Company) seized Kamilaroi land.
  - **Selectors**: Poor farmers given infertile plots; lived in bark huts.
- **North America**:
  - Homestead Act (1862): 160 acres free to settlers who farmed for 5 years.

### 4. Assisted Migrants

- Governments funded skilled workers (e.g., blacksmiths, carpenters) to settle colonies.

## Agricultural Revolution → Industrial Revolution

### Agricultural Changes

- **Enclosure**:
  - Displaced peasants → urban migration (e.g., Manchester’s population ↑ 400% by 1800).
- **Technology**:
  - Crop rotation (turnips, clover) improved soil fertility.
  - Selective breeding (e.g., larger sheep for wool).

### Industrial Innovations

1. **Textiles**:
   - Spinning jenny (1764), water frame (1769), power loom (1785).
   - Cotton imports ↑ 800% (1780–1800) due to slave labor in Americas.

2. **Steam Power**:
   - James Watt’s engine (1775) powered factories, mines, and railways.

3. **Transport**:
   - Railways (e.g., Liverpool-Manchester line, 1830) enabled mass coal transport.

## Industrial Working Conditions

### Factory Labor

- **Hours**: 12–16 hours/day, 6 days/week.
- **Wages**:
  - Men: 15 shillings/week.
  - Women/Children: 7 shillings (women), 3 shillings (children).
- **Health Risks**:
  - Cotton mills: Lung diseases from airborne fibers.
  - Poor sanitation → cholera outbreaks.

### Child Labor

- **Tasks**:
  - Cleaned machinery; crawled into mine shafts ("hurriers").
  - Chimney sweeps: Forced into narrow flues (often suffocated).
- **Reforms**:
  - **Factory Act (1833)**: Banned under-9s; limited children to 8-hour days.
  - **Mines Act (1842)**: Prohibited women/children underground.

## Forced Migration: Slavery and Convicts

### Slavery’s Global Impact

- **Economic Foundations**:
  - Profits funded British industries (e.g., Barclays Bank, railways).
  - Example: Liverpool’s wealth built on slave trade (40% of EU enslaved people shipped from there).
- **Resistance**:
  - Olaudah Equiano’s autobiography exposed Middle Passage horrors.

### Convict Transportation

- **Australia**:
  - First Fleet (1788): 750 convicts to Sydney Cove.
  - Political prisoners: Tolpuddle Martyrs (1834), Irish rebels.

## Impact on Indigenous Peoples

### Australia

- **Eora People (Sydney)**:
  - Smallpox (1789) killed 50%+; survivors dispossessed.
  - Lieutenant Bradley: "All dead! All dead!" (1789 journal).
- **Kamilaroi (NSW)**:
  - Land seized for sheep grazing; forced onto missions.

### Americas

- **Native Populations**:
  - Disease (smallpox, measles) reduced populations by 90%.
  - Enslaved Africans replaced Indigenous labor.

## Gold Rushes: Case Studies

### California (1848–1855)

- **Demographics**:
  - 300k migrants (including 25k Chinese).
  - San Francisco: 1k → 25k residents (1848–49).

### Australia (1851–1860)

- **Eureka Stockade (1854)**:
  - Miners protested £1/month license fees; 22 deaths.
  - Outcome: License replaced by cheaper "miner’s right."

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Enclosure**: Privatization of communal land, forcing peasants into cities.
- **Luddites**: Workers destroying machinery to protest unemployment.
- **Chartists**: Reformers demanding universal male suffrage (1838–48).
- **Middle Passage**: Transatlantic voyage of enslaved Africans (15–20% mortality).

> **Exam Strategy**:
> - Link events (e.g., Enclosure → Urbanization → Factory Labor → Reforms).
> - Use specifics: Irish Famine (push) vs. Australian gold rush (pull).
> - Highlight Indigenous dispossession (e.g., Eora smallpox, Kamilaroi land seizures).
