# WWI TRENCHES

## Trench Warfare: Digging in

The main fighting in World War I took place on the Western Front. The battleground stretched from the Belgian coast in the north to the Swiss Alps in the south and was marked out by lines of trenches. Seldom more than one metre wide and perhaps two metres deep, these trenches were home to millions of troops. Over four long years both sides' armies lived, ate, slept, fought and died amidst the horror that was trench warfare.

## Not just a line

Most battlefield trench lines were made up of a number of defensive structures. The most common arrangement was the three-line trench system. This allowed front-line trenches for firing at the enemy, reserve trenches to hold reinforcements ready to join the fighting and support trenches where troops could be rested. The trenches were dug in zig-zag patterns so that the blast from an exploding artillery shell was isolated to a small area, protecting men further down the trench line. This zig-zagging also helped if the trench lines were overrun by the enemy, slowing their advance. Communication trenches linked all three trench lines, allowing for the movement of troops and information.

As the war progressed many trenches were expanded and became almost permanent homes for the troops. Some German trenches extended up to ten metres underground.
