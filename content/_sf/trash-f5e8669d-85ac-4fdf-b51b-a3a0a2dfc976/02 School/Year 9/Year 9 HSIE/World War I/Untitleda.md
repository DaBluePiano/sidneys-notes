# Where World War One Was Fought

Perhaps the most enduring image of World War I is that of soldiers in the trenches, covered in mud and blood, and surrounded by barbed wire. Such images were characteristic of the drawn-out war on the Western Front in France and Belgium, where Australian troops fought from 1916 to 1918. Although this was generally regarded as the most important theatre of war, there were many others (see Source 1):

- on the Eastern Front (also known as the Russian Front) between Germany and Russia in Eastern Europe; this continued until the Russians made a separate peace with Germany in 1917
- in northern Italy, where the Italians (who had left the Triple Alliance) fought against Austria-Hungary
- in the Middle East, where Allied forces, including the Australian Light Horse, fought against the Turks in Gallipoli, where the combined corps of Australian and New Zealand (ANZAC) troops joined with other units of the British army in a failed invasion of Turkey.

The fledgling Australian navy was also involved with British forces throughout the war, and in a famous action in November 1914, while travelling to join the war, HMAS Melbourne sank the German raider Emden near the Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean.

Stalemate on the Western Front

In 1914, the widely held view was that World War I would be a short war. However, after the initial movement of the German army, which marched through Belgium and deep into France, the war on the Western Front became a stalemate. This was primarily due to the fact that in the period 1914-18, the weapons and technology available to the armies in the form of artillery, machine guns and barbed wire gave the advantage to the defender. (It was not until World War II that this changed.) On the Western Front, the consequence was that the British and French could not drive the Germans out of France, and the Germans could not advance any further.
