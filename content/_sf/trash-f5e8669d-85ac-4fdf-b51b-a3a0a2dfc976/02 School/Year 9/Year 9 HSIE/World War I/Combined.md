# World War I
## The Origins of World War I

World War I had its origins in rival alliances, national competitiveness, an arms race and a climate of tension among the major powers — Austria–Hungary, Britain, France, Germany and Russia. Any issue among them that could not be resolved could lead to war. The European powers had spent years preparing for war and their peoples had come to think of war as a normal and likely occurrence.

### Nationalism, war and adventure

In the late nineteenth century, many Europeans had come to think of war as a heroic adventure in which they might one day have the chance to participate. Newspaper articles, cartoons, novels and songs presented a romantic image of war and the adventurous life of a man in uniform.

Governments encouraged nationalism and patriotism to unify people who often still felt more loyal to their local area than to their nation. Countries saw involvement in war as evidence of a nation’s maturity. Education encouraged and focused students’ attention on past wrongs and current threats that other European powers had or were supposedly inflicting on their nation.

People took pride in all things military. Parents dressed their young children in sailors’ suits and gave their sons toy soldiers to play with. In England, children eagerly awaited the fortnightly instalments of Robert Baden-Powell’s Scouting for Boys, which helped boys (and girls) learn many of the skills of resourcefulness, which he had previously used in training soldiers.

### Tensions and rivalries

People saw war as the likely outcome of the rivalries among the great powers in the areas of:

- competition to take advantage of trading opportunities
- competition to control territory and resources in Africa that would give nations access to raw materials that weren’t available in Europe
- the development of weapons and ships that nations could use to protect their interests
- the size and strength of armies and navies and the arms race (especially between Britain and Germany) that resulted from this individual power and status.

### War plans and the arms race

One nation’s attempts to protect its interests led others to fear its power. In 1898, Germany set out to create a navy twice the size of Britain’s. In 1906, Britain launched the HMS Dreadnought, considered  to be the most powerful ship afloat. German engineers were soon copying this design, leading to further tension:

- Britain feared Germany’s navy and the possibility of such a navy cutting Britain off from the rest of its empire.
- Germany argued that its navy was essential to protect its trade.

### The alliance system

Increasing national rivalries within and beyond Europe resulted in nations forming two rival alliances. From 1907 onwards, the major powers were all members of one of these two rival and armed power blocs. Britain had joined with Russia and France in an alliance known as the Triple Entente, while Germany was linked with Austria–Hungary and Italy in the Triple Alliance.

These agreements increased nations’ sense of strength and protection and fostered the fear and mistrust of the nations that did not belong to them. They reflected the threat that the powers sensed from one another, and the desire to avenge past ‘wrongs’:

- Russia and Austria–Hungary competed with each other to extend their power in the area of south-eastern Europe known as the Balkans.
- France feared Germany’s army and sought revanche (revenge) for Germany taking the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine from France in 1871.

Between 1905 and 1913, tensions among the great powers increased as a result of crises in northern Africa and the Balkans. The great powers resolved these crises, although hostility generally increased among those involved.

### Assassination in Sarajevo

On 28 June 1914, at Sarajevo in Bosnia, 23-year-old Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist, shot dead the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his wife Sophie. Franz Ferdinand was the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. His assassination provided an excuse for Austria–Hungary to attempt to punish and weaken its long-time enemy, Serbia.

The ‘July crisis’ that developed from the assassination involved, through their alliances, all the major European powers and it ignited the tensions among them. Their failure to resolve the July crisis demonstrated nations’ desires to exercise their power and also their fears of one another (see source 5). By 4 August 1914, Europe was at war.

## The Causes of WWI

**M**ilitarism
**A**lliances
**N**ationalism
**I**mperialism
**A**ssassination

### Militarism

- Germany was competing with the UK to build battleships.
- The British feared an attack on their Empire
- Germany was competing with Russia and France to expand their armies

|         | 1880  | 1914 |
| ------- | ----- | ---- |
| Germany | 1.3m  | 5.0m |
| France  | 0.73m | 4.0m |
| Russia  | 0.40m | 1.2m |
![[image-38.png|500x424]]

### Alliances

- By 1914 all the major powers were linked by a system of alliances.
- The alliances made it more likely that a war would start.
- Once started, the alliances made it more likely to spread.

### Nationalism

- This was an age when all nations wanted to assert their power and independence.
- In Europe Slavs, aided by Serbia and Russia, wanted to be free of Austrian rule.

### Imperialism

- All the great powers were competing for colonies / territory.
- The British feared Germany in Africa.
- The Austrians feared Serbia / Russia in the Balkans.

### Assassination

- Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne was assassinated on 28 June 1914 by Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip, shot at close range while being driven through Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, formally annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908.
- Princip was part of a group of six Bosnian assassins, members of a student revolutionary group that later became known as Young Bosnia. The political objective of the assassination was to free Bosnia and Herzegovina of Austria-Hungarian rule.
- The assassination precipitated the July Crisis which led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia and the start of World War I.

### Significant People

Kaiser Wilhelm II

- Built up German army and navy
- Aggressive foreign policy
- Determined to make Germany a top nation.
- Distrusted by other powers

Count Berchtold

- Austrian Prime Minister
- During the July crisis, decided on a very tough ultimatum for Serbia.

Bethmann Hollweg

- German Prime Minister
- Gave very strong support to Austria during the July crisis while Kaiser was cruising on his yacht

### Crisis

28 June 1914

- Heir to Austrian throne Franz Ferdinand visits Sarajevo.
- Capital of Bosnia, recently grabbed by Austria.
- Hotbed of Slav nationalism.
- "Black Hand" terrorists attack the Arch Duke.
- Gavrilo Princip shoots Archduke and his wife.
- Austrians blame Serbia for supporting terrorists.
- Austrians, supported by Germany, send Serbia a tough ultimatum.
- Russia mobilises her troops to support Serbia.
- Germany demands that Russia stands her armies down.
- Germany declares war on Russia.

### Why Did Britian Get Involved?

- Britain had Ententes with France and Russia.
- Only "friendly agreements" but French and Russians given impression Britain would fight.
- The Schlieffen Plan

### The Schlieffen Plan

- Germany's military plan to defeat France and Russia.
- "Knock out blow" aimed at France first.
- Avoid French defences by invasion of Belgium.
- Germans thought Britain would not intervene.

### Britain's Plan

- 1838 - UK had signed a Treaty to protect Belgium.
- Did not want Germany to defeat France and dominate Europe. Britain next?
- UK issued ultimatum to Germany to withdraw troops from Belgium. War declared August 4 1914

### Australia's Reaction

Australia would support Britain "to the last man and the last shilling."

- Australians seemed very eager to go to war.
- They tended to think of warfare as short, heroic and glorious.

## The Causes of WWI

- The war had a lot to do with a shifting balance of power in Europe
- Tensions arose through competition for colonies and resources. 
- Some countries were becoming stronger than others.
- In order to protect themselves, nations built up their military forces and formed alliances with other countries

In time two major alliances stood opposed to each other.  These were:

| The Triple Alliance | The Triple Entente |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Germany             | Britian            |
| Austria-Hungary     | France             |
| Italy               | Russia             |

The Triple Alliance was a formal agreement between the three countries to help defend each other from attack. The agreement was renewed yearly until the war began.

The Triple Entente (a French word meaning ‘friendship’ or ‘understanding) ‘was an informal agreement between the three countries to help each other.

### Assassination and Alliances

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdFnmLKsu-YyEVtCxL7NUZSB-T6k4ZEr-jrAhLaL-rgYn1vlkb1bJLmq1JXv9pwF5hZAdXEdfpWJOReJwpzaEWg5VMIHRriS4HbHEGZK3d5QyPk5YKmbvIvqDFDL8D0dOg8l5nHvw?key=FBL4Y7lapyme2_E3WmL8nVcu)

The spark to the conflict was the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand

- Austria blamed Serbia for the assassination and planned to attack it.
- Russia supported Serbia as they considered them to be slavic people like the Russians and were, therefore, historically related to the Russian people.
- Due to the Triple Entente, Russia was joined by Britain and France
- Germany chose to defend its ally Austria.

So:

1. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.
2. Russia warned Austria-Hungary not to attack Serbia and mobilised its forces against Austria-Hungary.
3. Germany warned Russia not to mobilise its forces against Austria-Hungary. When Russia refused, Germany declared war on Russia.
4. As part of its plan to win the war, Germany then declared war on France (as an ally of Russia).
5. To avoid the heavy defences on the border with France, Germany invaded France through Belgium.
6. Britain then declared war on Germany in support of Belgium and France, and on Turkey because of her alliance with Germany.
7. In the following months and years, other countries declared war, including:

- Austria on Russia
- Japan on Germany
- Austria on Japan
- USA on Germany
- USA on Austria-Hungary

This was now truly a world war.

### What about Italy?

Despite being one of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary prior to the war, Italy sensed that it would be advantageous to join with the Entente. At the start of the war in 1914, they remained neutral, then the following year, in 1915, they joined the Entente.

The two sides that fought in WW1 were:

| The Allies                                            | The Central Powers |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Britain (Including its Empire)                        | Germany            |
| France                                                | Austria-Hungary    |
| Russia                                                | Ottoman Turkey     |
| Belgium                                               | Bulgaria (1915)    |
| Italy (1915)                                          |                    |
| USA (1917)                                            |                    |
| Serbia, Portugal, Japan<br>& other minor participants |                    |

The Great War lasted from 28 July, 1914, when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia (one month after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand) and lasted until 11 November, 1918 when an armistice was declared between the warring parties.

### Results of “The Great War”

- 65 million men were mobilised
- 9  million soldiers were killed, died of wounds or sickness
- 21 million soldiers were wounded
- 17 million civilians were estimated to have been killed
- Huge destruction of property

## Long Term Causes - The Path to War

Though World War I began in 1914, its causes can be traced back to tensions and suspicions which had developed over a great number of years. The path to war involved nationalism, militarism, imperialism and alliances.

### The Path To War

#### Militarism

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfAmhEcDEtkS1aSB665T3resduu_9TZxuJp9ZgsQMqKXzAdO6idhcP_GJwG-VybQMb9_xHLdnL5tjnfqjDwnKP0_YqRLRC7wCrwBW0y5Hh1GQjDK7lmKaUJ8m_fo9LsqkItGc8w?key=W30t-2KSZySPiW3RRK04rOxl)

Militarism is a policy of developing powerful weapons and military forces to be used in defence or to attack other nations if this supports the national interests. In the lead-up to World War I all of the Great Powers of Europe were involved in increasing the strength of their armies and navies. This 'arms race', as it became known, greatly increased tensions between the nations of Europe.

#### Alliances

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfBZzy0wvzxhNGvSL9uHZ8RREThk9D1jqeYS55aNBWAFhAUCaZ8O9LOOBcBLUZVW-zi0Ru6sd6h7xhfQPoH-mBA9hrLcGDCnw2FurjPX9z2bYzj8ZdMaan6ZM679QP46n1QifFZsA?key=W30t-2KSZySPiW3RRK04rOxl)

Alliances are economic or military agreements made between two or more nations. In the lead-up to World War I the Great Powers of Europe came to form two very powerful alliances which became extremely hostile towards each other. The Triple Alliance of 1882 saw Germany, Austria and Italy sign an alliance in which all three nations agreed to support each other in time of war. The Triple Entente of 1907 saw France, Russia and Great Britain form a defensive pact aimed solely against the power of the Triple Alliance. The effect of these two alliances was to increase tensions between the Great Powers and to split Europe into two divided camps, each fearing the power of the other.

#### Nationalism

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf1ktyKiJU4raJ69QF3XPxTgOasJcuAk7bIo7WWyhbnLhOuuNYqSpc0qtX0AfTg-kgtf-vggkl2iKqse54WXuqv-wJh5B0lotlYtuaNGiXGJlXHlOTKbqnnfbT49pw36DGxQdO0oQ?key=W30t-2KSZySPiW3RRK04rOxl)

Nationalism is a strong loyalty for your own country and the belief that its needs are more important than those of other countries. By the beginning of the twentieth century, European nationalism had become aggressive. Nations turned against each other as they strived to become more powerful and important than the countries around them. 

#### Imperialism

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeSlltkVfiP2ZjfqJj7h8HyUpdt8294QDDuchLzjlGA0hAy-BITHNriZ4J0_em4WIKSnn84uuJ0HrJdFwBrZU6G5uHsHo5mZPoqAzGQGdUSHiFjw9VOYOnelj2yrWJXSnhOm0va?key=W30t-2KSZySPiW3RRK04rOxl)

Imperialism saw the nations of Europe compete with each other to establish large empires. The countries which made up these empires, known as colonies, provided raw materials, land for expansion, markets for manufactured goods, and military and trading bases for the European powers that controlled them. In times of war, colonies were expected to help fight for their colonial powers. This helped make the 1914-18 conflict a 'world' war.

Individually, any of these four long-term factors could have led to war. Together they combined to produce heightened tensions, fears and suspicions between the Great Powers. Because of these factors a 'war climate' developed where people began to believe that war was inevitable and that it was even something to be desired.

#### Who Were the Great Powers?

In the years leading up to World War I, the Great Powers of Europe were Britain, France, Russia, Germany, Austria, Italy and the Turkish Ottoman Empire.

## Australia’s Involvement in WWI

As Britain readied itself to declare war on Germany in August 1914, future Australian Prime Minister Andrew Fisher promised that 'Australia will stand behind our Mother Country to help and defend her to our last man and our last shilling'. Great Britain's war became Australia's war too. Fisher's comment reflected the attitudes of many Australians, who assumed Britain's war to be a just and noble cause in which Australians could demonstrate their loyalty to the 'mother country'. Like people of all nations, they believed that the war would be short, with the victorious troops home by Christmas, recounting tales of their glorious exploits.

### Enthusiasm for War

Pro-British war fever was the dominant emotion in most Australian cities following Britain's declaration of war on Germany on 4 August 1914. Newspapers, competing with one another to demonstrate their loyalty to the mother country, forecast countless heroic deeds against the hated enemy. This enthusiasm was especially significant because the Defence Act 1903 (Cwlth) limited the Australian Army to service in defence of Australia and only on Australian territory. Australia needed to attract volunteers to serve in an army outside Australia. This restriction did not apply to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), which participated in war under the command of Britain's Royal Navy.

Recruitment began on 10 August 1914. Within days, 40 000 men had volunteered. This was double the number the government had offered to send to Britain. By November, the first group of volunteers, including a large group of the Light Horse, had left for training in Egypt. By December 1914, 52 000 men had volunteered to serve in the army, to be known as the Australian Imperial Force (the AIF), which, when combined with New Zealanders, would form the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (the Anzacs). Three thousand men served with the Australian Flying Corps (AFC). With troops off to the battlefront, the Australian government reinforced its commitment to compulsory military training for all males between the ages of 12 and 25.

Initially, with plenty of volunteers, the Army could set high physical standards. Many men who would normally have been considered fit and healthy failed to meet those standards and were turned away. In 1914, the minimum height for acceptance into the AIF was 168 centimetres. By late 1914, recruitment officials had reduced this to 163 centimetres and by 1917 to 152 centimetres.

### Why Australians Enlisted

Support for the 'mother' country was not the only reason for Australian men's rush to enlist. 

**Other reasons included:**
- fear that the opportunity for 'adventure' would pass them by if they did not enlist quickly
- the desire to avoid the disapproval of peers and young women. Some women showed their disapproval of men who were not in uniform by giving them a white feather, a symbol of cowardice.
- the chance to earn higher wages (six shillings a day compared to one shilling a day for British soldiers)
- men's feeling that it was their ' duty' to enlist
- hatred of the 'Hun' (insulting name for Germans).

## The Schlieffen Plan

Increased tensions among the major powers led them to prepare strategies to be used if war broke out. Germany developed, and continued to update, a plan known as the Schlieffen Plan; France developed the war plan known as Plan 17.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdOsGmbZTOWekIQMYNVn4H_gY0uI4ru7ybhnhJLre6D9Wa9tWmkdBUyPaRSpsbujpBjcJP_RyvNJdXBonDqSviMvrnXc2Izum1CX-btXPtYreVhSJ25k9-mUEWM61i5_PyNFQXv?key=eP_kkTdacsPNuf2OUXzVAtSJ)Source 1 Map showing Plan 17 and the traditional view of the main features of the Schlieffen Plan

### Contestability: the Schlieffen Plan

In 2002, Terence Zuber’s book Inventing the Schlieffen Plan: German War Planning 1871–1914 began a huge debate among military historians about the Schlieffen Plan. Zuber based his work on documents that had become available from German archives only in the 1990s. He concluded that what historians have accepted for nearly a century as ‘the Schlieffen Plan’ never really existed. This would mean that the traditional view — that, to avoid a war of two fronts, Germany had to attack France once Russia had mobilised — was incorrect. According to Zuber, German officers invented the  Schlieffen Plan in the 1920s as a means of excusing their failed strategies. Other historians argue that the Schlieffen Plan existed and that the Germans implemented a modified version of it when war broke out. Debate continues with, as yet, no consensus.

## Where World War One Was Fought

Perhaps the most enduring image of World War I is that of soldiers in the trenches, covered in mud and blood, and surrounded by barbed wire. Such images were characteristic of the drawn-out war on the Western Front in France and Belgium, where Australian troops fought from 1916 to 1918. Although this was generally regarded as the most important theatre of war, there were many others (see Source 1):

- on the Eastern Front (also known as the Russian Front) between Germany and Russia in Eastern Europe; this continued until the Russians made a separate peace with Germany in 1917
- in northern Italy, where the Italians (who had left the Triple Alliance) fought against Austria-Hungary
- in the Middle East, where Allied forces, including the Australian Light Horse, fought against the Turks in Gallipoli, where the combined corps of Australian and New Zealand (ANZAC) troops joined with other units of the British army in a failed invasion of Turkey.

The fledgling Australian navy was also involved with British forces throughout the war, and in a famous action in November 1914, while travelling to join the war, HMAS Melbourne sank the German raider Emden near the Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean.

Stalemate on the Western Front

In 1914, the widely held view was that World War I would be a short war. However, after the initial movement of the German army, which marched through Belgium and deep into France, the war on the Western Front became a stalemate. This was primarily due to the fact that in the period 1914-18, the weapons and technology available to the armies in the form of artillery, machine guns and barbed wire gave the advantage to the defender. (It was not until World War II that this changed.) On the Western Front, the consequence was that the British and French could not drive the Germans out of France, and the Germans could not advance any further.

### Reasons for Attacking Turkey

By Christmas of 1914 1 million soldiers had been killed, Russia had lost its supply route through the Dardanelles and was threatening to surrender.

Great Britain’s Winston Churchill believed the navy could be used to defeat Turkey and thus resupply Russia.  

His goals were;

- To knock Turkey out of the war
- Re-open the supply route to Russia
- Open a new front against Germany’s ally Austria – Hungary

The naval assault of February, March 1915 failed.  So it was decided to attempt a series of landings along the Gallipoli peninsula to take out the forts and thus allow the navy to break through to Istanbul.

### The Gallipoli Campaign

- Britain decided after the failed naval attack, to make a landing and use soldiers to attack.
- The invasion began on the 25th April 1915 (ANZAC Day). The British and French forces landed at a point in the south of the Dardanelles, while the ANZACs landed at a point further north. The job of the ANZACs was to stop the expected retreat of the Turks.
- Unfortunately, the ANZACs decided to “dig-in” rather than continue to advance into Turkish territory. This gave Turkey plenty of time to organise a defence.
- As a result, the Gallipoli campaign became a trench war, with neither side gaining any advantage.

### Conditions in the Trenches

By the middle of 1915, the weather had become hot and there were plagues of disease-carrying flies and fleas. Supply ships brought in water from Egypt but there was never enough.

By October, the weather had turned to bitter cold, mud and ice. Troops who arrived in peak physical condition soon suffered from illnesses such as diarrhoea, dysentery and gastroenteritis. Toilets were open pits.

Turkish soldiers, as close as 30 metres in some places, kept the ANZACs under constant fire. Consequently, corpses lay rotting in no-man’s land and wounded men lay for hours awaiting medical attention.

### Lone Pine and the Nek

British Commander, Sir Ian Hamilton, tried to break the deadlock at Gallipoli by attacking Turkish strongholds at Lone Pine and the Nek. The intention was to draw attention away from the British troops landing further south, at Suvla Bay and allied attacks at Sari Bair.

LONE PINE

- Australian troops emerged from secret tunnels close to the Turkish line.
- Australian troops were gunned down as they charged the Turkish trenches.
- Despite the odds, the ANZACs succeeded in taking Lone Pine but at a huge cost.

The NEK

- Hundreds of men from the 3rd Light Horse “went over the top” of their trenches in four suicidal charges against the Turks, only 27 metres away.
- The bombardment that was supposed to clear the trenches largely overshot its target and there was a seven minute gap between the end of the bombardment and the charge, giving the Turks both warning and time to prepare.
- Communication was disrupted, so a fourth wave left the trenches when they didn’t need to.
- This attack was a failure. 234 men died in 45 minutes.

### Evacuation of Gallipoli

- Campaign leader, Sir Ian Hamilton gave optimistic reports to the British Government despite strategists beginning to realise that they had little chance of beating the Turks at Gallipoli.
- Journalist Keith Murdoch smuggled a letter reporting the true situation to the British Prime Minister.
- Hamilton was replaced by General Sir Charles Munro who advised evacuation.
- They began evacuation in early December.
- They devised a number of tricks to hide the withdrawal:
	- Australian troops remained quiet for long periods of time.  When the Turks appeared to find out what was happening they opened fire. 
	- They organised a method whereby water dripped into a pan attached to a trigger enabled a gun to fire by itself.
- By 19th December the evacuation was complete, with only 2 casualties.  By this time, there were 26,000 casualties among the ANZAC troops, including 10,000 deaths.

## Gallipoli Strategy and Conditions

### The British Plan to Break the Stalemate

By Christmas 1914, one million Allied soldiers had died on the Western Front. The British government had begun searching for a way to break the stalemate. This meant relieving Turkish pressure on Russia, who, having lost access to its supply route through the Dardanelles, was threatening to surrender. If that happened, Germany would be able to transfer its troops from the Eastern to the Western Front and possibly defeat the Allies.

Winston Churchill, the civilian head of the British Navy, believed the Allies could win the war by using warships to attack and defeat Germany’s new ally, Turkey. The goals were to:

- force Turkey out of the war
- re-open the supply route to Russia
- open up a new front from which to attack Germany’s other main ally, Austria–Hungary
- move on to defeat Germany on the Western Front.

Source 2 (previous page) Map showing the proposed route of the naval campaign in the Dardanelles and the benefits the Allies hoped to gain from it.

The first plan was to move British and French battleships through the Dardanelles and capture Turkey’s capital at that time, Istanbul (which Westerners called Constantinople). The naval assaults in February and March 1915 failed as mines and shellfire inflicted severe damage on British and French ships. British military authorities then decided to instead attempt a series of land invasions at various points along the Gallipoli Peninsula. The attackers would comprise British, Anzac and French troops. They would use infantry (ground troops) to destroy the forts and mobile artillery that protected the Dardanelles Strait and threatened the British and French fleets.

### Gallipoli: the Nature of Warfare

#### The Landing

The invasion began on 25 April 1915 with British and French forces landing at beaches S, V, W, X and Y around Cape Helles and also on the opposite shore of the Dardanelles. The Anzacs were to land at Gaba Tepe and Ari Burnu and prevent Turkish troops retreating from the south and Turkish reinforcements arriving from the north.

The campaign began badly because:

- the failed naval bombardment had alerted the Turks to the likelihood of a land attack
- the Turks then had six weeks’ advance warning to prepare their defences
- by the time British and Anzac troops landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula, the Turks, under German General Liman von Sanders, had organised reinforcements, strengthened defences, laid mines, constructed trenches and established themselves on the high ground around both sides of the Gallipoli Peninsula and further inland
- Allied leaders missed opportunities and underestimated the Turks’ military capabilities and determination.

#### Contestability: Myth and Reality at Anzac Cove

At 4.30 am on 25 April 1915, 16 000 Anzac troops began landing under cover of darkness at a tiny beach, later known as Anzac Cove. They were two kilometres north of the original intended position at Gaba Tepe.

Australian letters and diary entries from the time, and secondary accounts in the nearly 100 years since, record troops leaving their landing craft to face an unrelenting barrage of Turkish machine-gun fire. They describe Turkish forces at both ends of the beach and at the top of its steep cliffs ready and waiting to gun down the invaders. The increased availability of Turkish sources (such as messages, signals and military reports) in the last few years is providing information that supports a different version of events. In particular, Turkish sources indicate that it was unlikely that Turkish troops were either expecting invaders to land at Anzac Cove or that, at the time of the landing, they were retaliating with machine guns:

- Turkish forces were deployed in small numbers at posts along the 60-kilometre coastline of the Gallipoli Peninsula. Their role was to report landings and delay invaders as long as possible. Reserves waited in central locations inland, ready to move once the landing spots were known, but could not arrive until some hours later. 
- There were only somewhere between 90 and 250 Turkish troops at the cove itself.
- There was a severe shortage of machine guns throughout the Turkish army.
- It was only when reinforcements arrived, around 7.30–8.30 am, that the Turks began using machine guns against their Anzac enemies.

No Australian accounts mention anyone seeing a Turkish machine gun, and there are no records of Australian troops capturing any when they gained higher ground later in the day. Some military historians believe that Australian casualties would have been much higher had the Turks been using machine guns early in the day.

Historians have come up with a number of hypotheses to explain why Australians might have incorrectly recorded being under enemy machine-gun fire:

- Some may have purposely tried to increase the sense of danger and threat that they encountered in their first experience of enemy fire.
- Some may have repeated rumours that what they heard was machine-gun fire.
- Even experienced soldiers cannot always tell the difference between heavy and rapid rifle fire and machine-gun fire.
- Any machine guns they did actually hear may have been their own.

As this example shows, Turkish sources have already led historians to question traditional accounts of the Gallipoli landing. Increased efforts to access and translate more of these in the lead-up to the 2015 Gallipoli centenary should open up more areas of debate and lead to a greater depth of understanding of all aspects of the Gallipoli campaign.

#### April–August 1915

The Anzacs initially began to head for the cliffs and their first-day objectives — Hill 971, the Third Ridge and MalTepe Hill. Possibly as early as 6 am, Australian commanders ordered the Second Brigade to abandon this offensive and instead to provide support for troops on the right flank, who were supposedly under threat from Turkish reinforcements. Troops then began to dig in at the Second Ridge.

As more and more Turkish reserves arrived, the Anzacs lost the opportunity that had existed for them to make significant advances into Turkish territory in the first three or four hours after their arrival. By digging in instead of continuing to advance against the vastly outnumbered Turks, the Anzacs ended up on the defensive. By nightfall of the first day, the Anzacs had failed to reach their first-day objectives.

They had advanced only about 900 metres at a cost of about 2000 casualties, including 621 dead. Over the next week, another 27 000 soldiers landed at Anzac Cove, where they tried to maintain control of the beach and construct trenches — all under the constant barrage of Turkish fire from distances as close as 30 metres and with little chance of regaining the initiative lost on the first day.

Soldiers armed with entrenching tools and sandbags hastily constructed the trenches and dugouts that would provide them with some protection. The task was difficult because the men mainly had to lie on their stomachs, using the entrenching tool without its handle.

Standing up to dig normally would have made them easy targets for the Turks. Over the following weeks, dugouts appeared all over the hillsides above Anzac Cove.

These were the places where the Anzacs ate, slept, wrote letters home, darned holes in their socks, smoked cigarettes and waited until they were called to active duty.

#### May 1915

On 19 May 1915, 42 000 Turks advanced in an attempt to break through Anzac lines. They were unsuccessful and both sides paid a huge toll in the number of dead and wounded. The Turks and the Anzacs agreed to stop fighting for a few hours so they could bury their dead and collect the wounded from no-man’s land.

Source 5 An extract from Gallipoli: the Turkish story by Kevin Fewster, Vecihi Basarin and Hatice HÜrmÜz Basarin

After a month of continual fighting and ceaseless noise, the sudden tranquillity seemed unreal … It was a welcome chance to stretch without fear of being shot. For the first time in many weeks, men could stand and survey the whole landscape. It was also a unique opportunity to meet the enemy. Men stepped up to the ceasefire line and swapped smiles, photographs, cigarettes and small gifts with each other. An Australian ambulance officer found the Ottomans ‘peaceful-looking men, stolid in type and of the peasant class mostly. We fraternised with them and gave them cigarettes and tobacco …’.

Shallow graves were excavated and the dead were buried where they lay. Mercifully, the day was cool, but it was a vile task nonetheless … [An] Australian felt eternally grateful to the

Ottoman medico who gave him pieces of scented wool to block his nostrils. Before the day was through, some four thousand bodies had been buried. At 4.30 pm, as arranged, the men climbed back down into their trenches … At 4.45 pm, a single shot rang out. Soon, the chatter of rifle fire returned to its normal level.

In June and July 1915, the main fighting involved British attacks — for limited gains — and Turkish counter attacks in the Cape Helles area. Both sides suffered the high casualties that were a feature of trench warfare.

#### Living Conditions

Conditions at Gallipoli tested everyone’s endurance. By mid-year, the weather had become hot and there were plagues of disease-carrying flies and fleas. Supply ships brought in water from Egypt, but there was never enough. By October, soldiers were beginning to experience the bitter cold, mud and ice that were characteristic of a Turkish winter.

Source 7 An extract from the writings of author Ion Idriess, describing life at Gallipoli

I wrapped my overcoat over the tin and gouged out the flies, then spread the biscuit, held my hand over it and drew the biscuit out of the coat. But a lot of flies flew into my mouth and beat about inside. I nearly howled with rage.

Quoted in B. Gammage, The Broken Years: Australian Soldiers in the Great War, ANU, Canberra, 1974.

Troops who had arrived in peak physical condition soon suffered dysentery, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis and infestations of lice. It was virtually impossible to keep clean. Toilets were open pits. Corpses lay rotting in no-man’s land between the opposing trenches because it was unsafe to try to retrieve them for burial. Wounded men lay for hours awaiting medical attention. During some weeks in the Gallipoli campaign, as many as 20 per cent of the men were sick from diseases relating to poor hygiene.

Turkish soldiers, as close as 30 metres in some places, kept the Anzacs under constant threat with hand grenades, sniper fire, mortar bombs and shell blasts. The casualty rate was generally 23 per cent. It was difficult to escape either physically or psychologically from the war.

## Gallipoli Battles and Outcome

### August 1915: Lone Pine and the Nek

#### Lone Pine

In August, the British, under regional commander Sir Ian Hamilton, decided to try a new tactic to break the deadlock. Anzac troops were to attack the Turkish strongholds at Lone Pine and the Nek in the hope of distracting attention from Allied troops landing at Suvla Bay and Allied attacks at Sari Bair. The aim was for them to gain control of Sari Bair and link the Anzac front with Suvla Bay.

At Lone Pine, the Australians surprised the Turks by emerging from underground tunnels that extended to about half-way between their own lines and the Turkish lines. However, they became easy targets for Turkish gunfire until they found a way into the Turkish trenches, which were covered with logs and earth. The Anzacs succeeded in taking Lone Pine but at a huge cost to both sides. Over four days of bitter hand-to-hand fighting, from 6 August to 10 August, the Anzacs suffered 2300 casualties and the Turks suffered 6000. Seven Australians gained Victoria Crosses as a result of this action.

#### The Nek

The attack at the Nek was even worse. In the early hours of 7 August 1915, hundreds of men from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade went ‘over the top’ of their trenches in four virtually suicidal charges against the Turkish trenches at ‘Baby 700’, only 27 metres away. The attack failed for a number of reasons:

- New Zealand troops were meant to attack at the same time from Chunuk Bair, which leaders believed they could capture the night before. This would mean they would be attacking from the rear of Turkish troops at Baby 700. However, it was 8 August, 24 hours later, before the New Zealanders even got to Chunuk Bair.
- Allied artillery shells from a preliminary bombardment overshot their targets.
- A seven-minute gap between the end of the artillery bombardment and the beginning of the infantry attack meant that the Turks had both warning of what was to come and enough time to prepare for it.

With the New Zealanders unable to attack from behind Turkish lines, there was no reason to begin what would become a frontal attack on heavily defended Turkish positions. Not having received any counter-instructions, the first and second waves of the Light Horse went ‘over the top’ and faced relentless machine-gun and rifle fire from the Turkish trenches.

Major Antill, second in charge of the Brigade, was convinced that some Australians had reached the Turkish trenches. He insisted, despite protests from another of the Light Horse commanders, that a third wave go over the top as well. This had better results only because the soldiers knew to hit the ground as quickly as possible. Colonel Hughes, commander in charge of the 3rd Light Horse, then cancelled the attack. This was too late for the fourth wave, who had already left their trenches. In a 45 minute period, there were 372 casualties among the Light Horse, of whom 234 died.

|   |
|---|
|The most tragic feint attack, at once the most gallant and the most hopeless, was made by the 8th and 10th Light Horse Regiments against the Turkish trenches at The Nek. The Nek was a ridge 50 yards wide at the Anzac line, narrowing to about 30 at the Turkish front. The opposing trenches on it were about 20 yards apart, and at least five Turkish machine guns covered the intervening ground. Four lines of the light horse, each of about 150 men, were to seize the enemy front line and the maze of trenches and saps behind it, on Baby 700. They would be preceded by a naval and artillery bombardment, and were to attack at two minute intervals. The light horsemen were eager and confident, for this was their first great battle, and they expected to break from the interminable trenches into the open.<br><br>  <br><br>Sick men hid or escaped from their doctors to be in the charge . . .<br><br>  <br><br>At four in the afternoon of 6 August the artillery began a gentle bombardment. It intensified early on the 7th, but at four twenty three a.m., seven minutes before time, it ceased . . . In the enemy trenches soldiers cautiously emerged from shelter, lined their front two deep, fired short bursts to clear their machine guns, levelled their rifles, and waited. At four thirty precisely the first line of the 8th Light Horse leapt from their trenches. As their helmets appeared above the parapet, an awful fire broke upon them.<br><br>  <br><br>Many were shot, but a line started forward. It crumpled and vanished within five yards . . . The second line saw the fate of their friends.<br><br>  <br><br>Over their heads the Turk fire thundered undiminished, drowning out any verbal order . . . Beside them lay dead and wounded of the first line, hit before they cleared the trench. But they waited two minutes as ordered, then sprang forward. They were shot down. The 10th Light Horse filed into the vacant places in the trench.<br><br>  <br><br>They could hardly have doubted their fate . . . and they determined to die bravely, by running swiftly at the enemy. ‘Boys, you have ten minutes to live,’ their commanding officer told them, ‘and I am going to lead you.’ Men shook hands with their mates, took position, and when the order came, charged into the open. The bullets . . . tumbled them into the dust beside their comrades.<br><br>  <br><br>Moves were made to halt the fourth line, but too late, and these men, too, climbed out to be killed. It was now a little after five fifteen a.m. Two hundred and thirty-four dead light horsemen lay in an area little larger than a tennis court . . . One hundred and thirty-eight others were wounded . . . ‘It was heroic,’ wrote one who watched them, ‘it was marvellous . . . yet it was murder.’<br><br>Bill Gammage, The Broken Years, ANU, Canberra, 1974, pp. 73–5.|

### The Outcome

By late August 1915, some British military strategists were beginning to think that they had little chance of defeating Turkish troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula. At the same time, campaign leader Sir Ian Hamilton’s largely optimistic reports failed to indicate just how bad the situation was. This changed when Australian journalist Keith Murdoch arrived in London from Gallipoli in mid September.

Murdoch smuggled out a letter that English journalist Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett had written to inform the British Prime Minister, H.H. Asquith, of his concerns about the campaign and especially about Hamilton’s performance. When military officials confiscated Ashmead-Bartlett’s letter, Murdoch recorded his own version of it. Asquith and his ministers read this account, accepted it unquestioningly and in mid October dismissed Hamilton. The new commander, General Sir Charles Munro, advised evacuation rather than continue with what he predicted would be a 30–40 per cent casualty rate.

Allied troops began withdrawing from Anzac Cove and Suvla Bay in early December 1915. They devised a number of tricks to try to camouflage their withdrawal:

- Australian troops kept silent for long periods of time and then, when the Turks appeared to find out what was happening, they opened fire.
- They also organised a method whereby water dripped into a pan attached to a trigger would make a rifle fire itself.

By 19 December, the evacuation was complete, with only two casualties. By this time, there were 26 000 casualties among the Anzac troops, including about 10 000 deaths.

## The Western Front

After the Gallipoli campaign, the Australian infantry divisions went on to fight some of the worst battles of the war. Between 1916 and late 1918, 295 000 Australian soldiers served on the Western Front. The Battle of the Somme in France in 1916 and the Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium in 1917 are the two battles that most represent the needless slaughter of young Australian men on the World War I battlefields.

### 1916: The Somme

The Battle of the Somme (July to November 1916) was another doomed attempt at breaking the stalemate on the Western Front. The plan was to launch a major attack on German lines in the Somme River valley. The assault would begin with an intense artillery bombardment of German defences.

Then, 1.2 million soldiers would advance in wave formations along a 40-kilometre front. The aim was to cut the Germans off from behind and make them so demoralised that they would surrender.

The Germans had weeks of forewarning through:

- overheard field telephone messages
- the movements of British reconnaissance aircraft
- the observations of their own pilots.

When the attack began on 1 July 1916:

- German defences were well prepared
- British mines went off too early and alerted the Germans that the attack was due to start
- British artillery fire failed to destroy the barbed wire protecting the German trenches.

When the soldiers advanced into no-man’s land, they advanced into a non-stop barrage of German machine-gun fire. They became easy targets as their attempts to pass through the German barbed wire only made them become more entangled in it. The Allied troops did not have the machine-gun power needed to respond effectively. On the first day, the Germans killed over 20 000 Allied troops and wounded 40 000.

The attack failed to achieve a large-scale breakthrough, and tactics focused instead on raids on specific enemy targets such as those at Fromelles and Pozières.

### Fromelles (Pronounced ‘From-ell’)

Australian soldiers’ first battle on the Western Front was the ill-fated Battle of Fromelles on 19–20 July 1916. Their goal was to divert German attention from the main action to the south and prevent them sending reinforcements there. Planning was rushed, the soldiers lacked experience and the distance across no-man’s land was as much as 400 metres in some sections. After seven hours of Allied artillery fire, German machine gunners, with the added advantage of being on higher ground, were well and truly ready when British and Australian troops began their attack in the evening of 19 July. By the early hours of 20 July, the 5th Australian Division had 5533 casualties and one of the greatest losses of Australian lives ever within a 24-hour period.![|443x432](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcRBA3v7_XbEdfQr7BeyXpcyoBFvpwEd6oLo9HwcxMUKKaTzllGOo0LXi6X5n1pzmZ-vYaPt2RfcokPT5fryHLgrYDwugSTCeALwbXu6Jp0p_kLl8JDu-lz5OaaWWLa9xv_Pq3z?key=FEn95qkq-7eGZuetfIoQeRPu)

### Pozières (Pronounced “Pozzie-air’)

A few days later, the First Australian Division had the task of capturing the German-held town of Pozières. This was achieved in a few hours on 23 July 1916, but it took another

seven weeks of horrific fighting against ongoing German artillery fire to consolidate the gain. By this time, three more Australian divisions had become involved.

In July 1916, there were 90 000 AIF soldiers serving on the Western Front. By the end of August 1916, there were 23 000 Australian casualties from the Somme battlefields — nearly as many as for the entire eight months at Gallipoli. By the end of the Somme campaign, the AIF had lost more than 32 000 soldiers, with an overall gain in land of about 10.5 kilometres. Neither the average Australian soldier nor the average British soldier had much faith in their military leaders after this.

### 1917: Passchendaele (Pronounced ‘Pashendarl’)

From mid to late 1917, two Anzac divisions took part in fighting in and around Ieper (Ypres) in Belgium. This was the third battle of Ieper, also known as the Battle of Passchendaele. The battle was part of a British attempt to break through the German lines towards the North Sea ports, where the German U-boats were berthed. There were 7000 Australian casualties during the initial attack in June.

In July 1917, the British resumed artillery shelling of German defences. The Germans had the advantage of higher ground and a wide view of their attackers’ movements. Over the next fourteen weeks, Allied troops made ten attempts to break through to Passchendaele. Men and equipment became bogged down in mud and flooded fields. General Haig insisted that the attack proceed. When his chief of staff visited the battlefield, he reportedly had tears in his eyes as he said, ‘Good God, did we really send men to fight in that?’ Overall, the Allied forces suffered 300 000 casualties; 38 000 were Australian.

## WWI Trenches

### Trench Warfare: Digging in

The main fighting in World War I took place on the Western Front. The battleground stretched from the Belgian coast in the north to the Swiss Alps in the south and was marked out by lines of trenches. Seldom more than one metre wide and perhaps two metres deep, these trenches were home to millions of troops. Over four long years both sides' armies lived, ate, slept, fought and died amidst the horror that was trench warfare.

### Not just a line

Most battlefield trench lines were made up of a number of defensive structures. The most common arrangement was the three-line trench system. This allowed front-line trenches for firing at the enemy, reserve trenches to hold reinforcements ready to join the fighting and support trenches where troops could be rested. The trenches were dug in zig-zag patterns so that the blast from an exploding artillery shell was isolated to a small area, protecting men further down the trench line. This zig-zagging also helped if the trench lines were overrun by the enemy, slowing their advance. Communication trenches linked all three trench lines, allowing for the movement of troops and information.

As the war progressed many trenches were expanded and became almost permanent homes for the troops. Some German trenches extended up to ten metres underground.

1918: Towards Victory

Following Russian surrender in late 1917, Germany transferred more divisions to the Western Front. In anticipation of the arrival of US troops to fight on the Allied side, Germany launched a Spring Offensive in the Somme. After initial success, war-weary and poorly supplied German forces, facing sustained and well-coordinated Allied defence, failed to achieve a breakthrough.

4 July: the Battle of Hamel

1918 provided opportunities for new Allied commanders to use tactics and strategies that would make the most effective use of new technology. The Battle of Hamel on 4 July 1918 was the forerunner of the model for Allied attacks for the duration of the war. In 93 minutes the Anzacs, under the command of Lieutenant General John Monash, achieved their objective of capturing the town of Hamel. This was a key goal in facilitating the defence of Amiens and launching a counter-offensive against the Germans.

The success showed the benefits of Monash’s meticulous planning: allowing time for his orders to be circulated and fully understood, camouflaging his intentions with skilful use of diversionary tactics, and starting the operation under cover of darkness. Most importantly, he successfully coordinated the infantry with every form of weaponry and technology available — artillery and machine gun barrages, wireless, tanks and aeroplanes, with the latter two used for the transport of heavy weaponry as well as in combat. The attack conserved the energy of his troops and minimised their vulnerability to the enemy having advance notice of their plans.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc4aO2G6F_284UqIHO4JcAe5VNVCUvqFnKliKpff5vCJ5y2V30AJvjZroFuAs2LYdBJtoGls8QHL8NhZOA8l4c0jm05506YZSz-X00CP3-vjndb4kTP__uL1wYM9F2ALjN6hkz7VQ?key=WGqXbbfR4TYUaS2obZNRIQ)

The 100 days

On 8 August 1918, British, Canadian and Australian soldiers launched a massive offensive resulting in what German General Erich Ludendorff called der schwarze Tag — ‘the black day’ of the German army. Over the next 100 days, Allied forces relentlessly attacked German forces and, by early October, had broken through the entire depth of the defence system the Germans called the Hindenburg Line. With its army in retreat and its soldiers’ morale low, the German High Command asked the German government to obtain an armistice.

The armistice and ceasefire that ended the war came into effect at 11 am on 11 November 1918 — over four years after the war had started.

## Understanding Propaganda

Propaganda is information, ideas or argument used to further a cause or damage an opponent’s cause. Its purpose is to influence the audience to adopt a certain attitude or take a certain action.

Propaganda expresses information that supports a particular point of view — often a political idea — and does this in a way that will encourage an emotional response, rather than an objective or intellectual response.

In World War I, the Australian government used propaganda to gain and maintain support for the war and to encourage enlistment. Groups from both sides of the conscription debate used propaganda posters to influence people’s vote. Posters were a common means of spreading propaganda.

Techniques included:

- portraying the enemy as barbaric, non-human and incapable of justice or compassion, often through the use of stereotyping to make everything about the enemy unacceptable
- giving people a direct order, such as ‘Join Up today!’, so that people felt that someone in authority was telling them what to do
- appealing to feelings of nationalism and patriotism
- suggesting negative/unacceptable ideas in which opponents supposedly believed
- simplifying an idea to make it attractive or acceptable
- projecting a positive image and suggesting that the target audience can acquire this image by following the order the poster provides
- choosing words and phrases that convey positive concepts, such as ‘support’.

## The Changing Role of Women

Australian women did not have military and economic equality with men. Australia did not need women to replace men in the paid workforce as desperately as did countries like Germany and Britain. While women in those countries took on ‘men’s work’, Australian women’s main wartime work was in volunteer work and in poorly paid traditionally ‘female’ roles. The Australian government refused women roles that many would have liked as members of auxiliary units attached to the armed forces. Some women worked in non-fighting roles providing medical services near the war front.

### Voluntary Work

Lady Helen Munro-Ferguson, wife of the Governor-General, helped form the Australian Branch of the British Red Cross Society. She became its first president. The organisation’s patriotic focus and links with the social elite attracted many middle-class women, and significant donations from groups such as the Australian Jockey Club. Women attended working bees where, over the period of the war, they produced thousands of items of clothing for the soldiers abroad. The Red Cross also sent food parcels to Australian prisoners of war and provided assistance to families by establishing a Wounded and Missing Inquiry Bureau.

The Australian Comforts Fund (ACF) was the other key organisation for volunteer work. Women officially established it in 1916 by joining together similar organisations from each state. The ACF provided ‘comfort boxes’, which contained the ‘luxury’ food, clothing or other items that went beyond the basics supplied by the AIF. These included such things as:

- cakes and puddings
- biscuits, condensed milk and sugar
- cigarettes, tobacco and matches
- chewing gum
- Handkerchiefs
- writing materials
- Newspapers
- extra clothing
- messages of support.

In keeping with its motto, ‘Keep the Fit man Fit’ the ACF helped prevent trench foot by ensuring that soldiers, who had no washing facilities in the trenches, had an adequate supply of dry socks. Every few weeks, organisers sent 10 000 pairs of hand-knitted socks to the men overseas — each pair representing about ten hours of labour. By late 1918, Australian women had knitted 1 354 328 pairs of socks for the ACF.

Other important voluntary organisations were Sydney’s Soldiers’ Sock Fund, which sent 21 000 pairs of socks overseas each year and Adelaide’s Cheer-Up society, which helped organise food, concerts and gifts for soldiers.

Women’s voluntary work also supported the shipping costs of these organisations. They raised funds by making and selling cakes, running button days, fetes and street stalls, and by organising and participating in door-knock appeals. Voluntary work enabled some middle class women to develop skills in fundraising, organisation, management, and collection and distribution that they might not have gained otherwise.

### The AWSC

In late 1916, hundreds of women joined the newly-formed Australian Women’s Service Corps (AWSC). They wanted to prepare for a more active war role — performing noncombatant tasks at the battle front as ambulance drivers, cooks or hospital orderlies. They wanted work that would release the ‘able-bodied men who are now performing these duties’ for active military service. The AWSC also conducted basic military training for its members. The Defence Department refused to take these women seriously.

### The Paid Workforce

Women’s participation in the paid workforce rose from 24 per cent in 1914 to 37 per cent in 1918. Women found their war work largely restricted to traditionally ‘female’ areas of work in the food, clothing, footwear, printing and textile industries. They also continued to work as shop assistants, in office work, in teaching and as nurses.

The factory was well ventilated and well lit and this, along with the latest machinery, made it a ‘model’ for modern production methods.

Whenever women replaced men in the workplace, it was only as part of a ‘reserve’ labour force. This meant that people believed women had a short-term place in the workforce rather than a long-term right to a position there. Some women took temporary jobs in the police force, in farming, in factories and in small businesses. Clerical work was popular, with about 10 000 women undertaking this form of employment during the war. Unions feared that if women did ‘men’s work’ at female pay rates, they would threaten men’s jobs or force men to accept lower wages. Society expected that when the war ended, soldiers would return to their homes, their families and ‘their’ jobs.

Cartoon titled ‘That Promise’ from The Worker 10 February 1916

Women’s pre-war wages were usually about half of what men were paid for doing the same work. This was decided in the 1907 Harvester Case, in which Justice Higgins established the principle of a basic wage that would enable a man to support a wife and three children. Women’s wages were to be a percentage of this amount. In the Rural Workers’ Case in 1912, Justice Higgins refused women the right to equal pay for equal work because they ‘did not have to feed a family’.

He assumed that all ‘breadwinners’ were men and that all females would have a man to support them. World War I showed the reality to be different, with some men enlisting to escape unwelcome family responsibilities. The government responded by ensuring soldiers allocated part of their pay to wives and children at home.

### Women’s Recruitment Role

Australia needed to attract volunteers to serve in an army outside Australia as the law restricted the regular army to service on Australian soil. The government expected women to show their patriotism by putting pressure on men to enlist. It created posters depicting women as potentially helpless and passive victims of unrestricted German aggression, and enlistment as the only means of protecting them. In the conscription campaigns of 1916 and 1917, women launched appeals for both the ‘yes’ and the ‘no’ vote.

### Grief and Worry

Women on the home front were part of a community for whom sad news was an ever present threat. Many had a husband, brother, son or friend serving overseas. In a world without television or the internet, most had no mental image of the places where their loved ones battled, the conditions they endured or the cemeteries where they were buried.

Some women could balance the news of a loved one’s death with the thought that it had been for ‘a noble cause’. At the same time, they had to re-make their lives with the knowledge that someone they cared for would not return.

This was a personal and individual hardship that the nation could not share. As war continued and numbers of casualties on the Western Front multiplied, some women became more cynical and more questioning when faced with government and community expectations that they continue to express patriotic enthusiasm for war.

## The Conscription Debate

Australia’s involvement in World War I

### Conscription

Conscription meant forcing able bodied men of military age to fight in the war. This means that the government could randomly select men of the appropriate age and make them go to war. If the men refused to go, they would be breaking the law.

The Conscription Debate was very divisive. This was especially because the war was being fought overseas and Australia was not directly threatened. Was it acceptable to force people to fight for wars in other countries?

## Conscription in Australia

As the news came from Gallipoli that more troops were needed on the Front, the call for recruits was sent out across the Empire.

Britain passed laws to introduce conscription in January 1916. Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes wanted to follow suit and held the first referendum to poll the Australian population in October 1916. The voting was close and a NO vote was passed. A massive recruitment drive was launched across the Empire; however, supply could not meet demand as huge losses were experienced in the trenches and on the battlefields of Somme and Ypres. 

A second referendum was held in December 1917 and this time, a resounding NO came from the Australian public. Many attributed this change in public opinion to the climbing death toll on the battlefields.

As a result of two failed referendums, Conscription was not introduced in Australia during the Great War.

### Propaganda Techniques

Propaganda means deliberately presenting a one sided story, usually through news items, books or posters.

Both sides of the conscription debate exaggerated their case by playing on peoples’ emotions such as:  Guilt, Duty, Hatred, Loyalty, Patriotism and particularly, Love of family.

## The Anzac Legend

### Creating the Anzac Legend

The Gallipoli campaign and the Anzac legend that emerged from it have had a significant impact on ideas about Australia’s national identity. Although a military defeat, reports of Australians at Gallipoli have had a profound effect on how Australians view themselves. For many people, the participation of Australian soldiers in the Gallipoli campaign symbolises Australia’s coming of age as a nation and demonstrates the qualities that characterise Australians. British war correspondent Ellis Ashmead- Bartlett (1881–1931) helped to create this legend with his newspaper report on the Gallipoli landing.

|Source 1 An extract from Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett’s newspaper article ‘Australians at Dardanelles: thrilling deeds of heroism’ reporting on Australians landing at Gallipoli. Ashmead-Bartlett ‘observed’ the landing from a battleship some distance away and did not arrive at Gallipoli until 9.30 pm on 25 April.<br><br>  <br><br>The Australians, who were about to go into action for the first time in trying circumstances, were cheerful, quiet and confident. There was no sign of nerves nor of excitement . . . the boats had almost reached the beach when a party of Turks, entrenched ashore, opened a terrible fusillade with rifles and a Maxim [machine gun] . . .<br><br>  <br><br>The Australians rose to the occasion. Not waiting for orders or for the boats to reach the beach, they sprang into the sea and, forming a sort of rough line, rushed at the enemy trenches.<br><br>Their magazines were not charged, so they just went in with cold steel. It was over in a minute. The Turks in the first trench were either bayoneted or they ran away and their Maxim was captured.<br><br>  <br><br>Then the Australians found themselves facing an almost perpendicular cliff of loose sandstone . . . Somewhere, half-way up, the enemy had a second trench, strongly held . . . Here was a tough proposition to tackle in the darkness, but those colonials, practical above all else, went about it in a practical way . . . They stopped for a few minutes . . . got rid of their packs, and charged their magazines.<br><br>  <br><br>Then this race of athletes proceeded to scale the cliffs without responding to the enemy’s fire. They lost some men, but did not worry. In less than a quarter of an hour the Turks were out of their second position, either bayoneted or fleeing . . .<br><br>  <br><br>The courage displayed by the wounded Australians will never be forgotten . . . Though many were shot to bits, without hope of recovery, their cheers resounded throughout the night . . . They were happy because they knew they had been tried for the first time and not found wanting . . . There has been no finer feat in this war than this sudden landing in the dark and storming the heights . . .<br><br>Argus, 8 May 1915.|

This was the first report on the landing that Australian newspapers published. It found an appreciative and ready audience among those who:

- were concerned about Australian soldiers’ reputation for being ‘undisciplined’, gained while they were training in Egypt
- feared that Australians might have behaved poorly in their first military engagement
- wanted to see Australian soldiers at least equal the efforts of British and Canadian troops (who had performed well in France)
- were looking for a positive national identity for Australia that was distinct from that of Great Britain
- were concerned about how people of other nationalities would judge Australia in the world arena.

Australians at home responded enthusiastically to this praise. Enlistment figures for June 1915 (12 505) were nearly double the figures for April. In July, they soared to 36 575 — nearly a 300 per cent increase on the month before.

People used extracts from Ashmead-Bartlett’s report in fund-raising brochures, theatre playbills and in a booklet that the New South Wales Department of Education distributed to schoolchildren. One film-maker used it as the basis of a 1915 film entitled The Hero of the Dardanelles (filmed at Tamarama Beach, Sydney). One woman, in a letter distributed widely among soldiers, described her feeling on reading Ashmead-Bartlett’s account as ‘pride’, ‘exultation’ and the sentiment ‘Thank God, I am an Australian’.

From this time onward, reports of what Australians were doing at Gallipoli took precedence over reports of what the British or anyone else was doing. Ashmead-Bartlett became a media celebrity and people valued and enjoyed his reports.

Ashmead-Bartlett’s article inspired the creation of a framework for interpreting events and experiences on the Gallipoli Peninsula and identifying the characteristic features of the ‘true Australian’ — heroism, mateship, initiative, a disregard for authority, athletic ability, endurance and a cheeky sense of humour. Australia’s official war correspondent, Charles Bean, reinforced this image through his own reports from Gallipoli, through his 1916 best seller, The Anzac Book — a book of soldiers’ stories, poems and artwork — and ultimately in the 12 volumes of his Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–18. Bean was conscious of doing this and careful to reject any submissions to The Anzac Book that did not fit within this formula.

|Source 2 An extract from D.A. Kent’s ‘The Anzac Book and the Anzac Legend: C.E.W. Bean as editor and image maker’ in Historical Studies, vol. 21, no. 84, April, pages 381 and 382–3<br><br>  <br><br>[H]e excluded from The Anzac Book anything unpleasant which could not be treated humorously. The dirt, the flies, the cold, and the monumental discomforts of Gallipoli are all documented in The Anzac Book with a grim humour, but the danger, the brutality, the suffering, the waste of life, and the dehumanising effects of warfare are conspicuously absent . . .<br><br>  <br><br>In a revealing passage in his diary Bean noted how few men really wanted to fight, how some had to be forced into action at pistol point, how many wanted to run away (and many did) and some would ‘shoot their fingers off to escape from the front’. No trace of this reluctance was allowed to appear in The Anzac Book. Two good sketches were rejected even though they make fun of the coward and the malingerer, presumably because Bean’s ‘Anzac’ was neither of these; in embracing all Australian soldiers as ‘Anzacs’ in the souvenir, he was not prepared to admit to such behaviour . . .<br><br>  <br><br>In September 1915, Bean committed to his diary a lengthy appraisal of the Australian soldier in which he acknowledged that fear, cowardice and reluctance were the ‘true side of war’, but he added: ‘I wonder if anyone would believe me outside the army’.<br><br>  <br><br>malingerer: someone who pretends illness or  disability, especially in order to avoid duty or work|

### Contestability: Debating the Anzac Legend

From the late twentieth century onwards, Australian governments have again promoted the Anzac legend’s concept of Gallipoli as Australia’s ‘baptism of fire’ and the Australian soldier at Gallipoli as the personification of Australia’s national identity. Some historians believe that enthusiasm for Gallipoli and the Anzac legend is distorting the reality of our history. They feel that Anzac Day and the Anzac legend have become expressions of emotion, sentimentality and nostalgia that deny the reality of soldiers’ wartime experiences and undermine recognition of more significant events and values in Australia’s history.

In his 1992 Anzac Day address, then Prime Minister Keating declared: ‘Legends . . . define us to ourselves. But they should not stifle us . . . constrain our growth, or restrict us when we have to change’. In October 2008, he delivered a speech expressing his view that Australians should not see Gallipoli as the place where Australia was ‘born’ or ‘redeemed’ (see source 3).

|Source 3 An extract from Paul Keating’s speech of 30 October 2008 in which he expressed his view of what Gallipoli represents for Australia<br><br>  <br><br>The truth is that Gallipoli was shocking for us. Dragged into service by the imperial government in an ill conceived and poorly executed campaign, we were cut to ribbons and dispatched. And none of it in the defence of Australia. Without seeking to simplify the then bonds of empire and the implicit sense of obligation, or to diminish the bravery of our own men, we still go on as though the nation was born again or even was redeemed there. An utter and complete nonsense.<br><br>  <br><br>For these reasons I have never been to Gallipoli and I never will.|

### The ‘man with the donkey’

Private John Simpson Kirkpatrick (1892–1915) was an Englishman who had lived in Australia since 1910 after deserting his position in the merchant navy. Motivated by the hope of getting back to England, he enlisted in the AIF in August 1914 under the name ‘John Simpson’. He ended up at Anzac Cove. Simpson’s actions there were mentioned in official reports and became part of a 1916 book entitled Glorious Deeds of Australasians in the Great War. This was propaganda, which greatly exaggerated what Simpson had done and singled him out as a hero at a time when Australia needed new recruits.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd-bso90Y6CHDbA-vThL2jhVhuePDc4rzXE2Ut1pyJS4gKE7yL1lRCIuWdGlbaHcbriTLtq0Y-XjlaBkDU6k9fM0-mfz-dkV3rJRohSW4f1x2-AvgDx8PwcLnTxygV8SIb8HMssSQ?key=jSmGB1wCUgKdjom1_yq_wg)

Simpson served 24 days at Anzac Cove. He was meant to serve as a stretcher-bearer transporting seriously wounded men from the front lines back down to Anzac Cove. Instead, he chose to work alone, with a donkey, delivering water as he made his way up the heights above the beach, through the dangerous Shrapnel and Monash gullies to bring the wounded back down on his donkey. He and the two wounded he was transporting were shot dead in Monash Gully on 19 May 1915.

For many people, Simpson typifies the man of the Anzac legend. Others argue that he was English, a reluctant recruit and someone whose assistance to relatively few and not seriously wounded men, while noteworthy, did not make him a hero.

### Historians’ Criticisms

Historians who criticise the Anzac legend put forward the following points:

- The legend ignores the reality of Australia’s huge death toll fighting a war fought on foreign soil in the interests of Great Britain.
- Australians invaded Turkey and killed people defending their own land.
- Soldiers of all armies experienced mateship and many of the other values celebrated in the Anzac legend; these are not uniquely Australian.
- The fact that someone is heroic does not necessarily mean that they are morally right.
- World War I caused more division than nation-building in Australian society.
- At war’s end, Australia still had a British head of state and the British government still decided Australia’s foreign policy
- The Anzac legend ignores other important influences on Australia’s national identity — traditions of a ‘fair go’ and egalitarianism; support for economic, gender, racial and social equality; belief in democracy.
- Australia’s history before 1915, Federation, campaigns for social and political rights, and migration have also played significant roles in building the Australian nation.
- To say that wars are what make nations come of age is to accept the value system of the pre–World War I writers who sold a message that war was worthwhile.

|Source 5 An extract from historians Henry Reynolds’ and Marilyn Lake’s epilogue ‘Moving on’ in What’s wrong with Anzac?, 2010, page 167<br><br>  <br><br>Like many Australians who are concerned with the homage paid to the Anzac spirit and associated militarisation of our history, we are concerned with the way history is used to define our national heritage and national values. We suggest that Australians might look to alternative national traditions that gave pride of place to equality of opportunity and the pursuit of social justice: the idea of a living wage and sexual and racial equality. In the myth of Anzac, military achievements are exalted above civilian ones; events overseas are given priority over Australian developments; slow and patient nation-building is eclipsed by the bloody drama of battle; action is exalted above contemplation. The key premise of the Anzac legend is that nations and men are made at war. It is an idea that had currency a hundred years ago. Is it not now time to cast it aside?|

## The Treaty of Versailles

By the time the war ended in 1918, millions were dead, including 60000 Australians.

Germany was blamed for causing the war, and its traditional enemy, France, ensured that the peace settlement punished the Germans and made the country pay heavily for the cost of the war. The map of Europe was redrawn after World War I without the former empires of Russia, Austria-Hungary and Turkey. New countries such as Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia were created. The first communist state, the USSR, emerged from the collapse of the Russian monarchy. The end of World War I saw an international desire to create an organisation that would ensure world peace. Led by America in its new role as a world power, the League of Nations was formed.

![|406](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcPgu37iyj2R2AoE1-AwT5NDx4QMebDJZxFjSeHSYpyS13NCt_on8yffLcu-oCEmcFf6aHVFFRA3V4G_kSRD644wdbp6RA7k0xKSUMXwX0_b5KTQuE2FYtPY2DEIdYqw-W5uk9_?key=vX5qanV4Oz8BmsAYTDxgdw)

At the end of World War I, leaders of 32 Countries met at the Paris Peace Conference, which began on 12th January 1919, to discuss the Treaties to be made with each of the defeated powers. Negotiations were dominated by Britain (represented by prime minister David Lloyd George), France (represented by prime minister Georges Clemenceau), Italy (represented by prime minister Vittorio Orlando), Japan (represented by a former prime minister, Saionji Kinmochi) and the United States (represented by president Woodrow Wilson). Australia was represented by its prime minister, William (Billy) Hughes.

Division existed among these representatives on how Harshly the defeated countries should be treated. The United States wanted a fair and Just settlement, for example, whereas France (and Australia) wanted Germany to be severely Punished.

The French were to have their way. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28  June 1919, Germany was Reduced in size, lost its overseas colonies, could not have an Airforce or tanks, forbidden to unite with Austria, and had to pay reparations to the Allies for the cost of the War.

### Conditions for the Treaty of Versailles

Under the Treaty of Versailles, Germany had to:

- accept a vote to be held in northern Schleswig to settle whether the territory was part of Germany or not
- agree that Germany and Austria were never to be unified
- allow Danzig, which had been an important German port, to become a free city (the surrounding land became part of Poland)
- allow the Saarland (a resource-rich area) to come under French control
- be demilitarised and allow the Rhineland to be occupied by non-German armies for 15 years
- give Eupen-Malmedy to Belgium, Memel to Lithuania, and the Hultschin district to Czechoslovakia
- limit its army to 100 000 men and agree that Germany was not to have conscription, heavy artillery, poison gas, tanks, aircraft or airships, that its navy could not have vessels of more than 100,000 tonnes and that no submarines were allowed.
- pay war reparations of £6600 million (this is equivalent to approximately $2.6 trillion today, or more than two-and-a-half times the value of the entire Australian economy- its gross domestic product-in 2011)
- return the border region of Alsace-Lorraine to France
- surrender all of its colonies
- surrender Poznania, parts of East Prussia and Upper Silesia (on Germany's eastern border) to Poland
- take responsibility for starting the war (covered by the 'war guilt' clause)
