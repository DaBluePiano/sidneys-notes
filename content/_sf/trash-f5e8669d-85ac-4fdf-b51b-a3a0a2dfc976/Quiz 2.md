> [!question] Which type of data consists of distinct, separate values that are countable and often involve whole numbers?
> a) Continuous data
> b) Discrete data
> c) Qualitative data
> d) Quantitative data
>> [!success]- Answer
>> b) Discrete data

> [!question] What is the primary difference between an independent and a dependent variable in an experiment?
>> [!success]- Answer
>> The independent variable is manipulated or changed by the researcher, while the dependent variable is measured or observed to determine the effect of the independent variable's changes.

> [!question] Match the variable type to its description.
>> [!example] Group A
>> a) Independent Variable
>> b) Dependent Variable
>
>> [!example] Group B
>> n) The cause or input that is manipulated
>> o) The effect or output that is measured
>
>> [!success]- Answer
>> a) -> n)
>> b) -> o)

> [!question] The variable being changed in an experiment is called the `____` variable, and the variable being observed or measured is called the `____` variable.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> independent, dependent

> [!question] Qualitative data is numerical and can be measured.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> False

> [!question] Explain the difference between quantitative and qualitative data, providing at least two examples of each.  Further, elaborate on the practical implications of choosing between quantitative and qualitative data collection methods in a research study.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> Quantitative data is numerical and measurable, allowing for statistical analysis. Examples include height (in centimeters) and temperature (in degrees Celsius). Qualitative data is descriptive and non-numerical, focusing on characteristics and attributes. Examples include color (e.g., red, blue) and texture (e.g., rough, smooth).  The choice between quantitative and qualitative methods depends on the research question and the nature of the phenomenon being studied. Quantitative methods are suitable when measuring and comparing numerical values, testing hypotheses, and making generalizations to a larger population. Qualitative methods are more appropriate for exploring complex social phenomena, understanding individual perspectives and experiences, and generating hypotheses for future quantitative research.
