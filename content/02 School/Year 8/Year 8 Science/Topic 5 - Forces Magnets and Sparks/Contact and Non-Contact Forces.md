title: Contact and Non-Contact Forces

# Contact Forces

Often, forces can act between two objects that are in contact with one another. Familiar examples of contact force include the force of your hand pulling your shoelaces, the force of your hand on a bottle top as you unscrew it, and the force of your schoolbag pulling down on your shoulders.

Friction is a contact force between two surfaces that are sliding, or attempting to slide, over one another. For example, there is friction between the tyres of your bike and the ground when you pedal. Without friction, the tyre would just slip and you would not move forward.

# Non-Contact Forces

Forces can occur even between two objects that are not touching each other. These forces are called noncontact forces.

Gravity is a non-contact force. We can see the effects of the force of gravity acting between an apple and the Earth when the apple drops from a tree.

Magnetic forces can act without contact too. These forces act between two or more magnets, and some metals, such as iron.

Electrostatic forces sometimes cause your hair to stand on end immediately after you pull off a sweater.
