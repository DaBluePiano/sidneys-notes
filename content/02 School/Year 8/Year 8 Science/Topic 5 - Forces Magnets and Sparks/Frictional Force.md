title: Frictional Force

# Frictional Force
Friction is a force that makes the objects move together. If you push a toy train across the floor. It doesn't take much effort or force, because the toy is light. Try to push a real train. You probably can't do it because the force of friction the train and ground. The heavier the object, the stronger the force of friction.
# Friction
Friction is a force that acts against the movement of an object. It occurs between any surfaces that are touching and trying to move past each other. Objects travelling through air or water also experience friction. Friction is caused by the roughness of the surfaces that try and slide or roll over each other. Friction always acts in the opposite direction to the object's movement
Have you ever tried to walk across ice? It's difficult to start moving because you can't easily push off from the slippery surface. Once you're moving, it's then hard to stop. Walking along a concrete path is much easier. The rough concrete provides far more friction than slippery ice, allowing a better grip
# Using Friction
At times, friction can be a nuisance. For example: 
- Try sliding a heavy object across a rough surface. Before an object will move, you need to push or pull it with a force greater than the friction force. 
- Swimmers have to work hard to overcome the drag of the water. In other sports, like motor racing, cars need to be specially designed to keep drag from the air as small as possible. 
- When engine parts rub together, they can cause the engine to overheat.

At other times, we need friction. For example: 
- The friction between our feet and the ground means that we can push off and start walking. 
- On a flat road, the friction between a tyre and the road is needed to start the car moving. Without it, the tyres would spin on the spot and the car wouldn't move. Tyres are designed with tread patterns that optimise friction on the road. 
- Rubbing your hands together on a cold day helps to keep you warm. Whenever friction occurs, the temperature of the two interacting surfaces increases.
