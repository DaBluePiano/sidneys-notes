Any of various factors that cause a body to change its speed, direction, or shape.
## Contact
the act or state of touching physically
## Non-Contact
the act or state of not touching physically
## Unbalanced

## Field
A distribution in a region of space of the strength and direction of a force, such as the electrostatic force near an electrically charged object, that would act on a body at any given point in that region.
## Magnet
A material or object that produces a magnetic field. Lodestones are natural magnets, though many materials, especially metals, can be made into magnets by exposing them to a magnetic field.
