# Representing Forces
Scientists use arrows in diagram to represent forces. The direction of the arrow shows which way the force is acting. The length of the arrow shows how big the force is. The arrows that represent forces acting on an object should be drawn from the object's centre of gravity. All objects, including your body, have a centre of gravity.
