# Representing Forces
Scientists use arrows in diagram to represent forces. The direction of the arrow shows which way the force is acting. The length of the arrow shows how big the force is. The arrows that represent forces acting on an object should be drawn from the object's centre of gravity. All objects, including your body, have a centre of gravity.

# Balanced Forces
We say that forces are balanced because they try to move the object in opposite directions and they have the same size. As a result, no movement occurs.
The arrows describing the up and down forces acting on the kayaker are the same length. That shows that the forces are the same size. But these forces are acting in opposite directions. The mass of the kayaker (and the kayak) pushes down, but the buoyancy force pushes up. The two forces are balanced and so the kayaker does not move up or down.
# Unbalanced Forces
"An object will change its motion only if an unbalanced force is exerted on it."
