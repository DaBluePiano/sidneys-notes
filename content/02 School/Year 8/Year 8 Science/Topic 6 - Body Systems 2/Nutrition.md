## 1.2 Tests for nutrients
### 1.2.1 Test for Starch
> [!Experiment] Test for Starch
>Procedure 
>1. Label boiling tube A 'starch solution' and boiling tube B 'water'. 
>2. Place 2 cm of the starch solution into tube A.
>3. Place 2 cm of water into tube B. This acts as the control. 
>4. Add 2-3 drops of iodine solution to each tube. 
>5. Swirl each tube. 
>6. Record result.
### 1.2.2 Test for Fat
> [!experiment] Test for Fat
> Procedure 
> 1. Cut two pieces of brown paper of similar size. 
> 2. Place 2-3 drops of oil on one piece of paper and label it soil'. 
> 3. Place 2-3 drops of water on the other piece of paper and label it 'water'. This acts as the control. 
> 4. Leave both aside to dry.
> 5. Hold both pieces of paper up to the light. 
> 6. Record result.
### 1.2.3 Test for Protein
> [!experiment] Test for a Protein
> Procedure 
> 1. Label test tube A 'protein solution' and test tube B 'water'. 
> 2. Place 2 cm of the protein solution into tube A. 
> 3. Place 2 cm of water into tube B. This acts as the control. 
> 4. Add 2 cm of sodium hydroxide solution to each tube followed by 2-3 drops of copper sulfate solution (or add 2 cm of biuret reagent to each tube). 
> 5. Swirl both tubes. 
> 6. Record result.
### 1.2.4 Test for Glucose
> [!experiment] Test for Gloucose
> Procedure 
> 1. Label boiling tube A 'glucose solution' and boiling tube B 'water'. 
> 2. Place 2 cm of the glucose solution into tube A. 
> 3. Place 2 cm of water into tube B. This acts as the control. 
> 4. Add 2 cm of Benedict's reagent to each tube. 
> 5. Swirl each tube. 
> 6. Place both tubes in the hot water bath and heat for 5 minutes. 
> 7. Using the test-tube holder, carefully remove both tubes from the water bath and place in the test-tube rack. 
> 8. Record result.
# 2 Nutritional Diseases
Nutritional diseases in humans are disorders caused by an imbalance in nutrition. There are nutritional diseases caused by a lack of nutrients, while others that have excess nutrients. Other nutritional diseases are the result of poisonous components in foods. Nutritional diseases can result in death.
# 3 Nutritional Tips
## 3.1 Sodium
- Sodium is found in salt and is naturally occurring in some foods. While we do need small amounts of sodium for good health, too much salt is linked to increased risk of high blood pressure, which can increase your risk of cardiovascular (heart) and kidney disease. 
- Avoid adding salt to food when cooking and eating, and read labels to choose foods that have less than 120mg of sodium per 100g.
## 3.2 Sugar
Consuming a lot of added sugars, especially from foods like lollies, chocolate, cakes, biscuits, desserts and soft drink, can add extra kilojoules to your diet. 
- This can lead to weight gain and increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. 
- Too much sugar can also cause dental cavities. 
- Most fruits, vegetables, legumes and unsweetened dairy foods contain small amounts of naturally- occurring sugars which are not harmful.
## 3.3 Hygiene
**Hygiene** refers to conditions and practices that help to maintain health and prevent the spread of diseases. Basic personal hygiene practices:
- Washing yourself in a shower or a bath every day and changing into clean clothes. 
- Cleaning the teeth at least once a day. 
- Washing hands with soap after going to the toilet .
- Washing hands with soap before preparing and/or eating food. 
- Turning away from other people and covering the nose and mouth with a tissue or the hand when coughing or sneezing.
## 3.4 Bacteria
- Bacteria are micro-organisms (tiny living things). 
- Bacteria come in different shapes. Round bacteria are called coccus. Rod shaped are called bacillus. Spiral are called spirillum. Comma shaped, vibrio. 
- Bacteria are found on the human body, in soil, in oceans and rivers. On the food we eat and on objects that we touch. 
- Some bacteria are good and for example help us digest our food. 
- Other bacteria can make us very sick.
