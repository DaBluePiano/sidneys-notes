# 1 The Digestive System

>
> [!Definition] What is the Digestive System?
> The human digestive system is a complex series of organs and glands that processes food. In order to use the food we eat, our body has to break the food down into smaller molecules that it can process; it also has to excrete waste. The digestive system is essentially a long, twisting tube that runs from the mouth to the anus, plus a few other organs (like the liver and pancreas) that produce or store digestive chemicals.

# 2 Mechanical and Chemical Digestion

## 2.1 Mechanical Digestion

Mechanical digestion: refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can then be further broken down by digestive enzymes, e.g. the teeth cutting and grinding food.

## 2.2 Chemical Digestion

Chemical digestion: where enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use.

### 2.2.1 Enzymes

> [!Summary] The purpose of Enzymes
> - The purpose of an enzyme in a cell is to allow the cell to carry out chemical reactions very quickly. These reactions allow the cell to build thing or take things apart as needed.

- At the most basic level, a cell is really a little bag full of chemical reactions that are made possible by enzymes.
- Enzymes are made from **amino acids**, and they are proteins.

#### 2.2.1.1 Enzymes in the Digestive System

Enzymes are what the body uses to break down food items. Without enzymes, no food would get broken down or absorbed into the bloodstream.

It is the bloodstream that carries nutrients to every single cell in the body and the nutrients are the only thing that keeps the cells alive.

Enzymes are sort of the 'key' to getting all our nutrients back out of the food we eat. Without this 'key' our bodies would not be able to live. Water helps clean the stomach and helps digestion. Other fluids do not replace water as a digestive aid. Anything added to the water at all changes the function it has in the digestive system.

## 2.3 The Digestive Process

The digestive process is as follows

The Mouth -> The Esophagus -> The Stomach -> The Small Intestine -> The Large Intestine -> The End (Anus)

### 2.3.1 The Mouth

Food is partly broken down by the process of chewing and by the chemical action of salivary enzymes.

### 2.3.2 The Esophagus

After being chewed the food enters the esophagus. It uses wave-like muscles movements to force food from the throat into the stomach. This muscle movement gives us the ability to eat or drunk even when we're upside-down.

### 2.3.3 The Stomach

The stomach is a large, sack-like organ that churns the food and bathes it in a very strong acid (gastric acid).

### 2.3.4 The Small Intestine

After being in the stomach, food enters the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. In the small intestine, bile pancreatic enzymes, and other digestive enzymes produced by the inner wall of the small intestine help in the breakdown of food

### 2.3.5 The Large Intestine

 After passing through the small intestine, food passes into the large intestine. In the large intestine, some of the water and electrolytes are removed from the food. Many microbes in the large intestine help in the digestion process.

### 2.3.6 The End

Solid waste is then stored in the rectum until it i excreted via the anus.

# 3 Villi

The absorption of most of the nutrients into your body occurs in the last section of the small intestine. The finger-like villi on the walls give it a large surface area that speeds up nutrient absorption. Many tiny blood vessels called capillaries transport the nutrients from the villi into your bloodstream. Undigested food passes into the large intestine where water and vitamins may be removed.

# 4 Parts of the Digestive System

## 4.1 Mouth

Breaks down food into small pieces and mixes it with saliva

## 4.2 Liver

Produces bile and processes nutrients obtained from food

## 4.3 Gall Bladder

Stores bile

## 4.4 Rectum

Stores the waste until it leaves the body through the anus

## 4.5 Esophagus

Is a muscular tube down which food travels from the mouth to the stomach secretes juices that get digestion under way pancreas secretes enzymes into the small intestine

## 4.6 Small Intestine

Is the main site where food is digested

## 4.7 Large Intestine

Absorbs water from digestive waste

## 4.8 Anus

# 5 Teeth

Teeth come in four main types: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Each is shaped for a specific function. People have two sets of teeth during their lives: the 20 milk teeth emerge between the ages of about six months and three years. The 32 permanent teeth emerge from the age of about six years into the early twenties.
