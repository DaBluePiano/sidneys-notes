# 1 Levels of Organisation of Living Things

There are in all four levels of organisation of living things. The levels or organisation of living thins in sequence are the cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.

Cells -> tissues -> organs -> (organ) systems -> Organism

## 1.1 Cell

The **cell** is considered to be the basic unit of life. It is also known as the building block of life. A cell is bound by the cell membrane and has a nucleus which acts as the brain of the cell.

> [!Example] Examples of Cells
> Muscle Cell
> Nerve Cell
> Red Blood Cell
> Skin Cell
> etc.

### 1.1.1 Anatomy of Human Cells

## 1.2 Tissue

The **tissues** are a collection of cells which perform specialized functions. E.g. the cells in the heart, liver cells etc.

> [!Example] Examples of Tissue
> Skin Tissue
> Cardiac Tissue
> etc.

## 1.3 Organ

The various **organs** of animals include the lungs, brain, liver, etc. Roots, stem and leaves, etc. are different organs of the plants.

> [!Example] Examples of Organs
> Stomach
> Heart
> Lungs

## 1.4 Organ System

The **organ systems** are complex mechanisms which carry out important functions of the body. For example, the circulatory system in animals and vascular system in plants.

> [!Example] Examples of Organ systems
> Digestive System
> Skeletal System
> etc.

## 1.5 Organism

Amongst the different levels of organization of living things, this is the highest level. An **organism** could either be unicellular or multicellular. The organisms that are closely related are grouped together under a single species.

> [!Example] Examples of Organisms
> Humans
> Dogs
> Cats
> etc.
