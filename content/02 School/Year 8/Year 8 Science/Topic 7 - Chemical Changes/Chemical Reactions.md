# Reactions

> [!summary] What is a Reaction?

- The end products have different properties than each of the individual reactants.
- **Chemical equations** are a way to write out a chemical reaction. They can be written in word form, or in symbol form.
- **The Law of Conservation of Mass** - states that the total amount of mass is the same before and after a chemical reaction.

- # How do Chemicals React and Combine?

> [!Summary] How do Chemicals React and Combine?
> - Chemical reactions are happening all the time around us.
> - Chemical reactions occur when substance **combine** or **break apart**.
> - The starting substancse are called **reactants**.
> - The ending substances are called the **products**.

> [!Definition]
> **Compound** - substance that forms when 2 or more elements combine **chemically**.
> **Mixture** - substance that forms when two or more elements combine **physically**.
> **Solution** - is a mixture that looks like a single substance and has the same properties throughout (evenly distributed),
> **Solute** - the substance that dissolves.
> **Solvent** - the subsatnce into which the solute dissolves.
> **Suspension** - a mixture in which the components are dispersed, but large enough to see and to settle out.
