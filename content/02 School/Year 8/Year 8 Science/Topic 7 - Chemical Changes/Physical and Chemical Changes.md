# Physical Change

> [!Summary] What is a Physical change?
> When two or more substance combine and:
> - The bonds between atoms are not broken
> - It is generally reversible
> - Don't make new substances
> 
# Chemical Change

> [!Summary] What is a Chemical change
> When two or more substance combine and:
> - A new substance is formed
> - A solid appears or disappears
> - The temperature of substances changes spontaneously
> - A colour change occurs
> - Bubbles appear
> - A flame appears or light is produced
> - Where the chemical bonds between particles in molecules are broken or when new bonds are formed

A **new** substance is formed. These changes are **irreversible** or **permanent**. The new substance formed will have **different** properties compared to its original elements.

## Endothermic Chemical Reactions

> [!summary] What is an Endothermic chemical reaction?
> - Endothermic reactions absorb energy from the atmosphere in order to proceed
> - Endothermic reactions absorb energy, a temperature drop is measured during the reaction
> - Endothermic reactions are characterized by positive heat flow (into the reaction)
## Exothermic Chemical Reactions

> [!summary] What is an Exothermic chemical reaction?
> Some chemical reactions release energy in the form of heat, light, or sound. These are exothermic reactions. Exothermic reactions may occur spontaneously.
> They are denoted by a negative heat flow (heat is lost to the surroundings). In the lab, exothermic reactions produce heat or may even be explosive.


## Evidence of a Chemical Reaction
A chemical reaction is the process by which the atoms in one or more chemicals are rearranged to form new chemicals. Chemical reactions change substances into other substances. Evidence of a chemical reaction is said to have occured if you can observe one or more of the folliwing things when chemicals are mixed. 
- A temperature change
- A change in colour
- A new substance forming like a gas or a solid precipitate
- Disappearance of one or more reactants

## Precipitates

> [!Definition] Precipitates
> Precipitation is the creation of a solid form a solution. When the reaction occurs in a liquid solution, the solid formed is called the precipitate.
