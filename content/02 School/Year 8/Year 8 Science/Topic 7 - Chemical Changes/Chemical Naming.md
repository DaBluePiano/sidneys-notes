> [!FAQ] dont stress please :)
> Please don't stress about the actual contents in this. I honestly just wanted to play around with the notes and also maybe help if the topic was any confusing but its basically the class notes but with a **glowup** hehe ðŸ¤£
> Also dont overthink this topic and ur fine

# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Fixed Compositions Compounds

> [!NOTE] What is a compound?
> A compound is made up of different elements chemically combined in **a fixed ratio**.

> [!Example]
> For example, water (**H<sub>2</sub>O**) is a compound made only by joining together two atoms of hydrogen to one atom of oxygen.
> That is, the **ratio** of hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms in water is **awlays 2:1**

## 1.2 Subscripts

- A subscript refers to the number found on the lower right side of an element or attached to a compound.
- These numbers tell you how many atoms of which elements the equation is made up of.
- A subscript can never be changed to balance an equation.

> [!Remember] Remember
> It is not necessary to write the subscript 1.
> The oxygen atom is usually written at the end of the formula.

# 2 Writing Chemical Formulas

## 2.1 The Chemical Formula

Sodium Chloride, aka salt, has the formula NaCl. You read the formula like so ('N-a-C-l'). Sodium chloride is a solid compound and has the structure shown below, with sodium and chloride particles packed together tightly. There are no separate molecules, but the formula tells you that there are equal numbers of sodium and chlorine atoms.

A chemical formula is a shorthand way of showing which elements are in a compound. It also tells you how many atoms of each element are present in one molecule of the compound. For example, water has the formula H<sub>2</sub>O. This tells you that each molecule of water contains two atoms of hydrogen (H) and one atom of oxygen (O).

## 2.2 How do we name compounds?

> [!NOTE] Hydroxide
> A compound that contains hydroxide ions, OH<sup>-</sup> (a negatively charged ion made up of oxygen and hydrogen) is named a **hydroxide**.

> [!Example]
> - Potassium **hydroxide** - contains potassium ions and hydroxide ions.

## 2.3 Various Types of Chemical Formulas

### 2.3.1 Metallic and Non-Metallic

#### 2.3.1.1 Two Elements

> [!Rules]
> 1. The **metallic** element is named **first**.
> 2. The name of the **non-metal** is **shortened**.
> 3. The suffix **'ide'** is added to the shortened name.

> [!Example]
> NaCl - Sodium Chloride
> MgBr<sub>2</sub> - Magnesium Bromide

#### 2.3.1.2 Three or more elements

> [!Rules]
> 1. The **metallic** element is named first.
> 2. The **chemical radical** is named second.

> [!Example]
> FeSO<sub>4</sub> - Iron Sulfate
> Mg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> - Magnesium Nitrate

### 2.3.2 Non-Metallic and Non-Metallic

> [!Rules]
> 1. If **hydrogen** is present, it is named first.
> 2. If **no hydrogen** is present, the **solid non-metal** is named first.
> 3. If only **two elements** are present, the name of the second is shortened and the suffix '-ide' is added to the shortened form.
> 4. If only **two elements** are present, **prefixes** 'mon-', 'di-', 'tri-', 'tetra-' etc. are used on the name of the second to indicate how many atoms of it there are in the formula.
> 5. If **more than two elements** are present, the first is **named** and this is followed by the name of the **radical**.

> [!Example]
> HCl - Hydrogen Chloride
> CO<sub>2</sub> - Carbon Dioxide
> H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> - Hydrogen Carbonate

### 2.3.3 Common Names

The common names of particular elements have to be memorized.

> [!Example]
> HCl - Hydrochloric Acid
> H<sub>2</sub>O - Water

## 2.4 -ate Endings
>
> [!NOTE] -ate endings
> A compound that contains a negatively charged polyatomic ion containing oxygen usually has a name ending in **-ate**.

> [!Example] Example
> - Copper (II) sulph**ate** - contains oxygen atoms in the sulphate ion
> - Sodium nitr**ate** - contains oxygen atoms in the nitrate ion
