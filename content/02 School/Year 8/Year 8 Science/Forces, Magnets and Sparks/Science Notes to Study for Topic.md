- What is a force?
	- A push pull or twist
		- Push keeps things apart or makes them move apart
		- A pull keeps things together or makes them move cloer together
		- A twist makes things turn
- Forces in Action
	- A Force Can
		- Change the shape of an object
		- Change or stop of the movement of an object
		- Or do both
	- when a force changes the motion of an object
		- Make the object start moving or make it go faster
		- Make the object move more slowly or make it stop
		- Change the direction of the motion
		- Change the way that the object is spinning
		- Often more than one of these happens at a time
- Types of Forces
	- Define every type of force and also examples and also if it is contact or non contact
- Contact and Non Contact Forces
	- Contact
		- Contact forces happen when a force comes into contact with something. Give examples
	- Non Contact
		- Non Contact forces happen when forces does not need to come into contact with something. Give examples
- Representing forces
	- We use arrows in a diagam to represent forces
		- The longer the arrow is, the bigger the force is. 
- Balanced and Unbalanced Forces
	- Balanced Forces are balanced because they try to move the object in opposite directions and they are the same size, therefore no movemennt occurs. Give examples
	- Unbalanced forces are unbalanced when the forces are unequal.
		- An object will chnage its motion only if an unbalanced force is exerted on it
- Using Friction
	- Advantages and disadvantages of Friction
		- Advantages: Give examples
		- Disadvantages: Give examples
	- What Causes Friction?
	- Reducing Friction 
	- Useful Friction
- Magnetic Forces
	- Magnets pull objects without actually touching them.
	- The close the magnet is to the object, the greater the size of the pulling force
	- Permanent Magnets and Temporary Magnets
		- Permanent Magnets: explain
			- The only three metals that can form a magnet ferro magnetic
		- Temporary Magnets: explain
	- Opposites Attract
- Electrostatic Force
	- explain
- Measuring a Force
	- Unit for force is the Newton (N) after Sir Isaac Newton
	- A spring balanced is a device used to measure forces. 
		- An internal spring stretches as a force is applied to the spring balanced
		- Spring balances that contain stronger springs can measure larger forces
- Laws of Motion
	- Explain and Define all of them
	- ESPECIALLY NEWTON's THIRD
		- For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
- Difference between Mass and Weight
