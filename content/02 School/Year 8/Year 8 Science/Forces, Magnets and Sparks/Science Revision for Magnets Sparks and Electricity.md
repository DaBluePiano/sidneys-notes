### **What is a Force?**

- **Definition**: A force is a push, pull, or twist that can cause an object to change shape or motion.
  - **Push**: Moves objects apart or causes separation.
  - **Pull**: Brings objects closer together or moves them towards a point.
  - **Twist**: Rotates or changes the orientation of an object.

### **Forces in Action**

- **A Force Can**:
  - Change the shape of an object.
  - Start, stop, or alter the motion of an object.
  - Perform multiple effects at the same time.

- **When a Force Changes Motion**:
  - It can start movement or speed up an object.
  - It can slow down or stop an object.
  - It can alter an object's direction.
  - It can cause the object to spin or rotate.

### **Types of Forces**

Forces can be classified as **contact** or **non-contact** forces.

---

#### **Contact Forces**

These forces occur when two objects physically touch each other.

1. **Applied Force**
   - **Definition**: A force applied to an object by a person or another object.
   - **Examples**:
     - Pushing a shopping cart.
     - Pulling open a door.
     - Lifting a book off a table.

2. **Normal Force**
   - **Definition**: A force exerted by a surface to support the weight of an object in contact with it, acting perpendicular to the surface.
   - **Examples**:
     - A book on a table experiences an upward normal force from the table.
     - A person standing on the ground has a normal force exerted by the ground.
     - A chair supports a person sitting on it with a normal force.

3. **Frictional Force**
   - **Definition**: A force that resists the relative motion of two surfaces in contact, acting opposite to the direction of motion.
   - **Examples**:
     - Rubbing hands together creates heat due to friction.
     - Friction between tires and the road helps slow down a vehicle.
     - A sled slows down as it slides over snow.

4. **Air Resistance (Drag)**
   - **Definition**: A type of friction that acts against objects moving through air, depending on speed, shape, and surface area.
   - **Examples**:
     - A parachute slows down a skydiver by air resistance.
     - A cyclist experiences resistance while riding into the wind.
     - A falling leaf drifts down slowly due to air resistance.

5. **Tension Force**
   - **Definition**: A force transmitted through a string, rope, cable, or wire when it is pulled tight by forces from opposite ends.
   - **Examples**:
     - A rope in a tug-of-war is under tension.
     - Suspension bridge cables support the bridge under tension.
     - A person hanging on a rope experiences tension.

6. **Spring Force (Elastic Force)**
   - **Definition**: A force exerted by a stretched or compressed spring that returns it to its natural length.
   - **Examples**:
     - Pulling back a slingshot uses elastic force.
     - A stretched rubber band snapping back is due to elastic force.
     - Car suspension springs absorb road shocks with spring force.

#### **Non-Contact Forces**

These forces act at a distance without physical contact between objects.

1. **Gravitational Force**
   - **Definition**: A force of attraction between all masses, pulling objects towards larger masses like planets.
   - **Examples**:
     - Objects fall to the ground due to Earth’s gravity.
     - The Moon orbits the Earth because of gravitational attraction.
     - A thrown ball returns to the ground due to gravity.

2. **Magnetic Force**
   - **Definition**: A force of attraction or repulsion between magnets or magnetic materials, acting without contact.
   - **Examples**:
     - A compass needle aligns with Earth’s magnetic field.
     - Refrigerator magnets attract metal objects.
     - Two magnets attract or repel each other based on pole orientation.

3. **Electrostatic Force**
   - **Definition**: A force between charged particles, causing attraction or repulsion due to electric charges.
   - **Examples**:
     - A balloon rubbed on hair sticks to a wall from electrostatic attraction.
     - Static electricity makes hair stand up when touching a charged object.
     - Rubbing materials can cause them to attract or repel due to electrostatic force.

### **Contact and Non-Contact Forces Summary**

- **Contact Forces**:
  - Require physical contact.
  - Examples: Friction, Tension, Normal Force, Applied Force, Air Resistance.

- **Non-Contact Forces**:
  - Act over a distance without physical contact.
  - Examples: Gravity, Magnetic Force, Electrostatic Force.

### **Representing Forces**

- **Diagrammatic Representation**:
  - Forces are represented by arrows in diagrams.
  - **Arrow Length**: Indicates the strength of the force (longer = stronger).
  - **Arrow Direction**: Shows the direction in which the force acts.

---

### **Balanced and Unbalanced Forces**

- **Balanced Forces**:
  - Forces are equal and opposite, causing no change in motion.
  - **Example**: A book resting on a table has balanced forces (gravity and normal force).

- **Unbalanced Forces**:
  - Forces are unequal, causing a change in motion.
  - **Example**: Pushing a ball causes it to roll due to the unbalanced force applied.

---

### **Using Friction**

- **Advantages**:
  - Enables walking without slipping.
  - Allows brakes to stop vehicles.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Causes machinery wear and tear.
  - Produces unwanted heat in engines.

- **Causes**: Roughness of surfaces and the force pressing them together.
- **Reducing Friction**: Using lubricants, smoothing surfaces, or adding ball bearings.
- **Useful Friction**: Writing with a pen, where friction helps it grip the paper.

---

### **Magnetic Forces**

- **Definition**: A force acting between magnetic materials without contact.
  - **Properties**: The force is stronger as objects get closer.
  - **Example**: Magnets attract or repel depending on pole alignment.

---

### **Electrostatic Force**

- **Definition**: Attraction or repulsion between charged objects without physical contact.
  - **Properties**: Opposite charges attract, like charges repel.
  - **Example**: A charged balloon sticking to a wall.

---

### **Measuring a Force**

- **Unit**: The Newton (N), measuring the force’s strength.
- **Devices**: A spring balance measures force by stretching an internal spring based on the force applied.

---

### **Laws of Motion**

1. **Newton's First Law (Inertia)**: Objects remain at rest or in motion unless acted upon by an external force.
2. **Newton's Second Law**: Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma), meaning acceleration depends on the object’s mass and applied force.
3. **Newton's Third Law (Action and Reaction)**: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

---

### **Difference between Mass and Weight**

- **Mass**: The amount of matter in an object (in kg); constant regardless of location.
- **Weight**: The gravitational force on an object (in Newtons); changes with gravity, e.g., on Earth versus the Moon
