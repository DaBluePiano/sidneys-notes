# What is a Force?

>
> [!Summary] What is a Force?
> A force can be a push, a pull or a twist. We tell them apart by talking about directions.
> 1. A push keeps things apart or makes them move apart.
> 2. A pull keeps things together or makes them move closer together.
> 3. A twist makes things turn.

The world is filled with motion. Some motions just happen: the Earth revolves around the Sun, snowflakes fall to the ground, waves surge across the sea.

Other motions are under our control. We walk. We pick up things. We ride our bikes. But whether the movement is a planet revolving or you playing a game, the motion happens because of force.

Force is just a fancy word for pushing or pulling. If I push on something or pull on it, then I am applying a force to it. Forces make things move or, more accurately, makes things change their motion. Two natural forces that affect most of the motion we are aware of are the force of gravity and electromagnetic forces.

# Forces in Action

A force can:

1. Change the shape of an object
2. Change or stop movement of an object.
3. Or do both.

When a force changes the motion of an object, it may:

1. Make the object start moving or make it go faster.
2. Make the object move more slowly or make it stop
3. Change direction of the motion
4. Change the way the object is spinning.

Often more than one of these happens at a time.
