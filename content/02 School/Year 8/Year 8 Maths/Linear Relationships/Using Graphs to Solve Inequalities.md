- A horizontal line (parallel to the x-axis) has the rule in the form of $y=c$ where $c$ is any number
- A vertical line (parallel to the y-axis) has the rule in the form of $x=k$ where $k$ is any number
- A region in the plane is described using an inequality.
 	- All the points that satisfy the inequality form the shaded region
 	- A dashed line is used to show that the points on a line are not included in the region. A dashed line is used when the < and > symbols are given.
 	- A full line is used to show that the points on a line are included in the region. A full line is used when the $\leq$ and $\geq$ symbols are given.
