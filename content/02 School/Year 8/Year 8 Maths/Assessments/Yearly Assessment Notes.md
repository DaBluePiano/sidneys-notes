# Properties of Geometrical Figures
## Quadrilaterals
### Classifying Triangles
CONVEX
- All angles less than 180 degrees
- All vertices point OUTward

CONCAVE
- One internal reflect angle
- One vertex points INward
## Exterior Angle of a Triangle
- The <u>exterior angle</u> of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two <u>opposite interior</u> angles.
- For any triangle, the sum of two sides must be greater than the remaining side.
## Classifying Triangles

Equilateral Triangle: All sides and angles equal. (All angles are 60 degrees) All sides of the same length.

Isoceles Triangle: Two sides and angles equal. Two sides of the same length.

Scalene Triangles: No sides or angles equal. All sides of different lengths.

Right Angled Triangles: They have one 90 degree angle.

Obtuse Triangle: Any triangle that has an angle greater than 90 degrees. (The other two are acute)

Acute Triangles: Abt triangles that has three acute angles.


# Volume
## Volume Formula
$$V=Ah$$Where $V$ is the volume of the object
$A$ is the cross sectional area of the object
$h$ is the height of the object
## Cross Sections
A cross section of a prism  is where however many times you cut it, the 2-dimensional shape stays the same.

## Various **Cross Section** Formulas for other solids (multiply everything by the height ($h$) of the object)
Cube: $A=l^{2}$
Rectangular Prism: $A=bh$
Rhombic Prism: $A=\frac{1}{2}xy$
Trapezoidal Prism: $A=\frac{1}{2}(a+b)h$
Triangular Prism: $A=\frac{1}{2}bh$
Cylinder: $A=\pi r^2$
Semi-Cylinder?: $A=\frac{1}{2}\pi r^2$
Sector: $A=\frac{\theta}{360}\pi r^2$

## Composite Solids
Split the solid into various recognizable solids, and then add them together

## Difference between Capacity and Volume
**Volume** is the amount of space an object occupies whereas **capacity** is the amount of a fluid that an object can hold.

## Units and Conversions of Capacity and Volume
Capacity - mL, L, kL etc.
Volume - mm<sup>3</sup>, cm<sup>3</sup>, m<sup>3</sup> etc.

1cm<sup>3</sup> is 1mL
1m<sup>3</sup> is 1 kL (1000000cm<sup>3</sup> is 1kL)

# Linear Relationships
## Using Graphs to Solve Linear Equations
- We know that each point on the line is a solution to the equation 
- To solve a linear equation we can determine the x-value that corresponds to the required y-value on the line. 
## Using Graphs to Solve Inequalities

- A horizontal line (parallel to the x-axis) has the rule in the form of $y=c$ where $c$ is any number

- A vertical line (parallel to the y-axis) has the rule in the form of $x=k$ where $k$ is any number

- A region in the plane is described using an inequality.
	- All the points that satisfy the inequality form the shaded region
	- A dashed line is used to show that the points on a line are not included in the region. A dashed line is used when the < and > symbols are given.
	- A full line is used to show that the points on a line are included in the region. A full line is used when the $\leq$ and $\geq$ symbols are given.
## $y=mx+c$
$$y=mx+c$$
$y$ is the $y$ value
$m$ is the slope/gradient, also called the coefficient of $x$
$x$ is the $x$ value
$c$ is the $y$ intercept (where $y$ crosses the $x$ axis when $x=0$)

## Ways to solve a linear equation
### 1. Using table of value
Draw up a table of values with $x$ being -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 (or whatever is suitable)
eg. $y=2x+1$

| $y$ | -2  | -1  | 0   | 1   | 2   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $x$ | -3  | -1  | 1   | 3   | 5   |
Plot the points, join the line and add arrows and label the line.
### 2. Using $y=mx+c$ 
$c$ is the y-intercept so, plot (0, $c$)

$m$ is the gradient of the line, so convert it to a fraction, so if $m$ is a whole number, then make it $\frac{m}{1}$ and if it is fractional, keep it the same. 
This fractional form is basically $\frac{rise}{run}$ so rise is how much the line is going up for every 1 $x$. So, from your y-intercept, count $rise$ number of units up and $run$ number of units across. 

Join the line and add arrows and label the line.

# Angles
## Supplementary and Complimentary Angles

- Supplementary Angles are angles that add up to 180 degrees.
- Complimentary Angles are angles that add up to 90 degrees.
## Types of Angles

- Co-interior - They form a 'c' shape, and are supplementary.
- Corresponding - They make a 'f' shape and are equal.
- Alternate - They make a 'z' shape and are equal.
