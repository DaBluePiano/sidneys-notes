# The Development of the Model of the Atom

## Continuum Model

Substances are made up of the four elements: air, fire, water and earth. Substances can always be broken down into smaller pieces of the same substance.

*Ancient Greek Philosophers*

## Hard Sphere Model

Substances are made up of hard, ball-like building blocks called atoms hat cannot be broken apart.

*Democritus (ca. 400BC)*

## Plum Pudding Model

Atoms are made up of a positive charged ball with negatively charged electrons stuck in it.

*Sir Joseph J Thompson (1897-1904)*

## Dynamide Model

Atoms are made up of moving particles called dynamides. Each dynamide is made up of a positively charged particle and a negatively charged particle.

*Philipp Lenard (1904)*

## Nuclear Model

Atoms are made up of a solid, positively charged nucleus surrounded by an electron cloud.

*Ernst Rutherford (1909-1911)*

## Planetary Model

Atoms are made up of a solid, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons orbiting the nucleus, like planets orbiting the Sun.

*Niels Bohr (1913)*

## Neutron Planetary Model

Atoms are made up of a positive nucleus that has both protons and neutrons. The nucleus is surrounded by electrons orbiting it, like planets orbiting the Sun.

*Sir James Chadwick (1932)*

## Electron Shell Model

Atoms are made up of a positive nucleus that has both protons and neutrons. The electrons from hells around the nucleus.

*Modern Atomic Physicists*
