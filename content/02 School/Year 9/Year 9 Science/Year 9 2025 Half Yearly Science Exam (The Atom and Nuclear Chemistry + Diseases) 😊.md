# The Atom and Nuclear Chemistry

## Parts of an Atom

- **Atoms** are the particles that make up all the substances in the universe. As they are the **smallest** particles of matter, they **cannot** be **created**, **destroyed** or **broken down** (indivisible).
- **Protons** are the **positively** charged particles found in the centre of each atom.
- **Neutrons** are the particles found in the centre of each atom that have **no charge**.
- The **nucleus** is the **positively** charged central part of the atom that contains protons and neutrons.
- **Electrons** are the **negatively** charged particles found in each atom.
	- Electrons orbit the nucleus in shells.
	- The first shell can hold up to 2 electrons. The second shell can hold up to 8 electrons.

### Subatomic Particles

| Subatomic Particle | Location                 | Charge | Relative Mass |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------ | ------------- |
| Proton             | Nucleus                  | 1+     | 1             |
| Electron           | Cloud around the Nucleus | 1-     | 1/1840        |
| Neutron            | Nucleus                  | 0      | 1             |

## Development of the Atom

- **Democritus** (460BC) observed that matter was **not continuous** but was made up of **tiny, solid and unbreakable particles**. He was the first to use the term atomos, meaning indivisible.
- **Dalton** (1808) suggested that different substances were made up of **different particles that had specific masses** and properties – elements. In other words, the particles that made up gold were different from the particles that made up water. 

![[image-7.png|Dalton (Ball Model (?))|139x128]]

- **Thomson** discovered the **electron and its negative charge** in 1897. However, he also knew that there must be a source of positive charge in the atom to make it neutral. In 1904 he proposed what is known as the **plum pudding model**, where the atom was thought of as a round ball of positive charge with negatively charged electrons embedded in it.

![[image-8.png|Thomson (Plum Pudding Model)|158x131]]

- **Lenard** (1904) described atoms as **mostly empty spaces** filled with fast-moving ‘dynamides’. These were neutrally charged particles made up of a **heavy positive particle stuck to a light negative particle**.
- **Rutherford** (1909-1911) fired a beam of **helium nuclei at gold foil**. Most particles went straight through and only a small number were deflected. Rutherford concluded that atoms are mostly empty space with a small, positively charged nucleus and a large negatively charged electron cloud.

![[image-9.png|Rutherford|164x156]]

- **Bohr** (1913) modified Rutherford’s model, proposing that electrons can only travel along certain pathways around the nucleus, called **orbits**. His model is therefore often known as the **planetary model**.

![[image-10.png|Bohr (Planetary Model)|165x148]]

- **Chadwick** (1932) **discovered the neutron!** He showed that the nucleus was not just a massive of positive charge but a cluster of positively charged neutrons and charge-neutral neutrons

## Isotopes and Decay

- The different forms of the atoms of an element with different numbers of neutrons are called **isotopes**.
- For example, Carbon-12 (6 protons and 6 neutrons) is the most common isotope form of carbon atoms in the natural world (about 98.9%). The box on the right shows how Carbon-12 is normally written. It is a stable form of this element. The unstable forms of this element are carbon-13 and carbon-14. Only 1.1% of natural carbon on the Earth is carbon-13 atoms (6 protons and 7 neutrons). Carbon-14 is a very small percentage of total carbon and is composed of radioactive carbon-14 atoms.
 ![|197x58](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXevl0L8Hd9z3w7c-L_xdhlh-R_og5W5VcSzLIDcnBMZqQSMtBIbPsz-UiDuMovxwB8KP1mjhbbwEKxWFMQIgpuN1cu2ai_sIvWuvBVwn5pdQvqDSOwcYcJG6mN_-NlaEMIgmPPUAA?key=1IUITQwnuslBUhI184TfLw)
- A carbon-14 atom breaks down naturally by **radioactive decay** to form an atom of the element nitrogen, an electron (known as a beta particle) and a release of electromagnetic radiation.
- This radiation can include **alpha particles** and **gamma rays** (in addition to **beta particles**).

Each type can penetrate different materials. 

- Half-life refers to the time you would need to wait for **half** of the amount of the radioactive material to **decay**.
- For more information, refer to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJgc28csgV0&t=98s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJgc28csgV0&t=98s)

### Transmutation

Nuclear decay can cause some atoms to change into compeltely different types of elements. This happens whenever the number of protons in the nucleus changes. For example, some sodium atoms decay by losing a proton. This converts them into neon atoms.

## Finding the Number of particles(?) in an Atom

**Protons** = **Electrons**
**Atomic Number** (the small(er) number at the top) = **Protons**
**Atomic Mass** (the bigg(er) number at the bottom, most of the time not a whole number)= **Protons + Neutrons**
**Neutrons** = **Atomic Mass** - **Atomic Number**

Round the **Atomic Mass** to get the most **common** or **abundant** isotope of an element.

### Finding the Number of Electrons in a given Shell

$$2n^2$$

Where n is the number of shells?

## The Periodic Table

If you look at the periodic table of the elements you can see that the elements are listed in order of their

- The Periodic Table is organised in **periods** (rows) and **groups** (columns). 
- As you move **across** a period, the atomic number of the elements **increases by one**.
- As you move **down** a group, the atomic number increases by **either 2, 8 or 18**.

There are three main groups of elements:

- **Metals** (Red) -
- **Nonmetals** (Blue)
- **Metalloids (Semi-metals)** (Yellow)

![[image-12.png|500x314]]

### Groups of the Periodic Table

The ones you need to know:

Group 1 - **The Alkali Metals** - They are very reactive

Group 2 - **The Alkaline Earth Metals** - They are reactive, but not as much as 1

Group 14 - **The Carbon Group**

Group 17 - **The Halogens**

Group 18 - **The Noble Gases** - They do not react

## Uses of Nuclear Energy

## Nuclear Reactions

### Fusion

In nuclear fusion, two small nuclei combine to form larger nuclei releasing energy. In the sun, the nuclei of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium (hydrogen-2) and tritium (hydrogen-3) fuse together to form helium nuclei, releasing neutrons and massive amounts of heat and radiation. Nuclear fusion has so far been reliably produced only at very high temperatures of millions of degrees. However, the quest to perfect fusion at low temperatures — called cold fusion — continues. If cold fusion were to be achieved, huge amounts of energy could be produced from just the hydrogen in water!

![[image-15.png|500x387]]

### Fission

Nuclear fission occurs when the nuclei of large atoms such as uranium or plutonium split to form the nuclei of smaller atoms, releasing energy in the form of radiation and heat. 

In some nuclear reactors, the fission of uranium-235 is caused when a neutron is absorbed by the nucleus. The nucleus splits to form two smaller nuclei (which are called fission products) as well as releasing more neutrons, gamma rays and heat energy. If the neutrons released in this process then go on to cause the splitting of other uranium-235 nuclei, a chain reaction occurs. The rate at which energy is produced can be controlled by limiting the number of neutrons that can react with other uranium nuclei. This is what happens in a nuclear reactor. The destructive power of nuclear weapons, on the other hand, is caused by an uncontrolled chain reaction.

![[image-13.png|500x359]]

## Nuclear Radiation

**Alpha** Particles (α) - Consist of two protons and two neutrons, making them relatively heavy and positively charged. They are not very penetrating and can be stopped by something as thin as a sheet of paper or even human skin.

**Beta** Particles (β) - Beta particles are fast-moving electrons or positrons emitted during radioactive decay. They have moderate penetration power and can be blocked by materials like plastic or aluminum.

**Gamma** Rays (ɣ) - Gamma rays are high-energy electromagnetic waves with strong penetration, requiring lead or concrete for shielding.

![[image-16.png|500x214]]

## Catalysts and Reaction Rates

The rate of almost every chemical reaction can be increased or decreased.

Factors that affect the rate of reaction are:

- Temperature
- Concentration of the reactants
- Surface area
- Agitation (mixing and stirring)
- Catalysts (chemical helpers)

## Physical and Chemical Changes

| Feature                     | Chemical Reaction                                                                   | Physical Reaction                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Change in Matter            | New substances are formed                                                           | Existing substance remains the same             |
| Formation of New Substances | Always forms new substances                                                         | Never forms new substances                      |
| Reversibility               | Often irreversible                                                                  | Often reversible                                |
| Energy Change               | May involve large energy changes (heat released or absorbed)                        | May involve small energy changes                |
| Examples                    | Burning wood, rusting iron, cooking an egg                                          | Melting ice, boiling water, dissolving sugar    |
| Key Indicators              | Color change, gas formation, precipitate formation, temperature change, odor change | Changes in shape, size, volume, state of matter |

### Physical Changes

A physical change does not break any bonds between the atoms of a molecule or make different substances with different atoms. They are usually reversible.

### Chemical Changes

Substances are said to have undergone a chemical change when the particles that make them up undergo change. Usually this occurs when the chemical bonds between particles in molecules are broken or when new chemical bonds are formed.

We say that a chemical reaction has occurred if at least one new substance has been formed.

All chemical reactions start with one or more reactants (ingredients) and result in one or more new products. The products are formed from the atoms of the reactants. 

No atoms are destroyed and no new atoms are created in a chemical reaction. It is simply a rearrangement of the atoms that are already there.

## Radioactivity

Background radiation can be measured with a **Geiger counter**.

They are usually tuned to best detect beta particles and gamma radiation, as they have the greatest potential to cause harm to our bodies.

When a radioactive atom breaks down, the particles and energy it shoots off knock electrons off billions of nearby atoms. These free electrons might have a tiny amount of charge, but when combined have enough power to cause a short electrical pulse. Every time a radioactive atom breaks down, knocking off nearby electrons, this builds up enough charge to create a pulse and therefore a "click" on the detector.

# Diseases

## Health and Disease

The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines **health** as a ‘[state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity](https://www.who.int/about/governance/constitution)’.

A **disease** is anything that makes you feel unwell, or makes you unable to function properly in a given environment.

## Types of Diseases

### Non Infectious Diseases

**Non infectious** diseases are not contagious and cannot be caught from another individual e.g. heart disease or diabetes

#### Types of Non Infectious Diseases

Many diseases are non-infectious. The diseases can be divided into the main groups — **genetic** diseases, **nutritional** diseases and **environmental** diseases.

##### Genetic Diseases

These diseases can be caused by **abnormalities** in one or more **genes**, an **incorrect number of chromosomes** or **faulty chromosomes**. **Mutagens** are physical or chemical agents that cause mutations in DNA, e.g. high- energy radiation, drugs, chemicals and some viruses. Genetic diseases include Down syndrome, sickle-cell anaemia, cystic fibrosis and haemophilia.

##### Nutritional Diseases

Diet involves not just the quantity of food but the **quality** and **variety of food** eaten. A **balanced** diet needs carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, minerals, water and fibre. Malnutrition is caused by an imbalance in the diet, e.g. excessive intake, or insufficient intake of food. Obesity is a growing problem and the increased weight and fat storage leads to blood pressure problems, hernias, heart problems and reduced life expectancy. Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa also put strain on the heart and cause fatigue and exhaustion. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies can cause serious problems if a range of foods is not eaten, e.g. scurvy is due to a lack of vitamin C.

##### Environmental Diseases

**Environmental** diseases are caused by some factor in the **environment**. Heavy metal poisoning, e.g. caused by mercury, lead, thallium, bismuth, occurs when people are exposed to either **toxic levels in a short time** or **low amounts over a long period of time**. Environmental diseases also includes the drug-related diseases which can be caused by medicinal drugs, legal social drugs, e.g. alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, legally available substances that are misused, e.g. glues, petrol 'sniffing', or illegal drugs.

### Infectious Diseases

**Infectious** diseases can be spread between individuals; Infectious **agents** or **pathogens** cause infectious diseases.

#### Organisms that Cause Infectious Diseases

**Fungus**
- Uni-cellular or multi-cellular
- Has cell wall and nucleus
*Examples: Tinea, Thrush, Ringworm*

**Protozoan**
- Unicellular or simple multicellular organisms
- Has cell wall and nucleus
- Some protozoa are **parasites** (organisms that lives on or in the body of another, the host, and takes nutrients from it)
*Examples: Malaria, Giardiasis*

**Bacteria**
- Unicellular organisms
- Has cell wall but no nucleus
*Examples: Chlamydia, Salmonellosis*

**Prion**
- Protein molecule that is
faulty and makes other
proteins faulty through
direct contact
*Examples: Mad cow disease*

**Virus**
- Contains genetic material in a protein coat
- Reproduces by hijacking living cell to replicate DNA
*Examples: Influenza, Norovirus, COVID-19*

**Not all micro-organisms are harmful to humans. In fact, some are very helpful. Some micro-organisms serve as food sources, others help decompose wastes, some help protect us from disease and others aid digestion.**

## Transmission

**Direct transmission** comes about by direct **contact** with the infected person or by contact with droplets of body fluid. Pathogens that are transferred by direct transmission commonly include bacteria and viruses that are sexually transmitted or airborne.

**Indirect transmission** occurs through an **intermediary agent** like an insect, air or contaminated water. Carriers of disease are called vectors.

Pathogens that are transferred by indirect transmission commonly include protozoans like Giardia and Malaria. An example of a vector is the mosquito that carries malaria from person to person.

How can we reduce the transmission of infectious diseases?

- Good **hygiene** practices
- Use of **antiseptics** and **disinfectants**
- **Quarantine**

## Lines of Defence

Our bodies deal with pathogens using three lines of defence.

### First Line of Defence

Your body’s first line of defence is designed to prevent the entry of invading pathogens. Some of these defences are **physical** barriers (such as skin, coughing, sneezing, cilia and nasal hairs) and others are **chemical** barriers (body fluids such as saliva, tears, stomach acid and acidic vaginal mucus).

### Second Line of Defence

- **blood clotting** - to stop additional infection through skin damage
- **inflammation** – to increase the amount of blood (carrying white blood cells) reaching an infected area
- **fever** – to heat up the body and destroy pathogens that cannot survive in extreme heat
- **phagocytosis** – large white blood cells envelope pathogens and destroy them via enzymes.

### Third Line of Defence

Specialised white blood cells - **lymphocytes** - can ‘remember’ if they have met a specific pathogen before.

They can recognise pathogens by the unique marker - **the antigen** - on their surface.

## Vaccination

![|289x283](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUcttZwC2TYblQ76TkUJH1gOy34yK8m7e26a32G9EG9mnWpCHerz6gOZD9xxPmNbg9CidJUltg0idee9nYMT3T0Xt8L8NMHtvtJM2Mt3mpbhUYD7VfOOL1zSLBaDyBRRhPz4WYwQOP4nisauzrNDT3fFry5d18Y=s2048?key=CaP1nVpb41UhyTHl3Z_iNQ)

Through **vaccination**, a person is prompted to produce antibodies without the disadvantage of becoming ill, which usually leads to **immunity**.

Vaccinations are often given as a **preventive** measure.

### Types of Vaccines

| Type                                        | Definition                                                                                                     | Example/s                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Live attenuated vaccines                    | contain a **weakened** (attenuated) version of the virus that most closely mimics natural infection.           | Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine |
| Non-live vaccines (whole cell)              | **inactivated** version of the entire pathogen (virus or bacteria)                                             | Hepatitis A, polio, influenza,                                      |
| Non-live vaccines (subunit)                 | include only **parts** of the virus or bacteria that **z** the antigens needed to stimulate an immune response | Pertussis (whooping cough)                                          |
| Nucleic acid-based vaccines (mRNA vaccines) | use **genetic** material (either DNA or RNA) from the virus or bacterium to stimulate an immune response       | Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine , Moderna COVID-19 vaccine                  |

## The WHO

- The **World Health Organization (WHO)** is a specialized agency of the United Nations which coordinates responses to international public health issues and emergencies.
- They bring together 194 countries and work on the frontlines in 150+ locations to **“confront the biggest health challenges of our time and measurably advance the well-being of the world’s people.**”
- [Targets and Key areas of work](https://www.who.int/our-work)

## Important Scientists on Diseases

**Alexander Fleming** - Discovery of penicillin through an accident **1928**
**Howard Florey** - Development of penicillin, treating the first patient with penicillin, increased penicillin production **1941**
**Louis Pasteur** - Principles of vaccination by infecting chickens with a diseases **~1879**
**Robert Koch** - identified the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis, cholera, and anthrax. **~Late 1800**
**Edward Jenner** - Smallpox vaccine, the world's first vaccine **1796**

## Endemic Vs Epidemic Vs Pandemic

### Epidemic

An **epidemic** is an outbreak of disease—that is, sudden localized incidence of a disease—that spreads quickly and affects many individuals at the same time. (eg. *Western African Ebola virus* epidemic (2013-2016))

### Pandemic

A **pandemic** is a type of epidemic, one with greater range and coverage. A pandemic occurs over a wide geographic area and affects an exceptionally high proportion of the population. (eg. *COVID-19* pandemic (2019-present))

### Endemic

If a disease lingers for a long time as an epidemic or a pandemic, it may eventually become **endemic** to an area, which means that it persists at a consistent level within a region. (eg. *Malaria* in Africa (the higher temperatures allow the Anopheles mosquito, which spreads malaria, to thrive. This means that malaria remains at constant levels in this region))

**Epidemic**: A rapid spread of a disease to a large number of people in a specific population or region (e.g., the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa).

**Endemic**: A disease that is consistently present in a particular geographic area or population (e.g., malaria in sub-Saharan Africa).

**Pandemic**: A global outbreak of a disease affecting multiple countries or continents (e.g., COVID-19).

**Pathogen**: A microorganism (e.g., bacteria, virus, fungus) that causes disease.

**Infectious**: A disease capable of spreading from one organism to another, directly or indirectly (e.g., influenza).

**Symptoms**: Physical or mental signs of illness experienced by a patient (e.g., fever, fatigue, coughing).

**Transmission**: The process by which a disease spreads (e.g., airborne, waterborne, or via vectors).

**Vector**: An organism (e.g., mosquito, tick) that transmits pathogens between hosts.

**Treatment**: Medical care given to cure, manage, or alleviate a disease (e.g., antibiotics for bacterial infections).

**Immunity**: The body’s ability to resist or fight off infections, either naturally or through vaccination.

**Antibiotic**: A drug that kills or inhibits the growth of bacteria (e.g., penicillin).

**Antigen**: A molecule (often on a pathogen’s surface) that triggers an immune response.

**Vaccine**: A preparation containing antigens, used to stimulate immunity against a specific disease (e.g., measles vaccine).

**Cilia**: Hair-like structures on cells (e.g., in the respiratory tract) that move mucus and trapped pathogens out of the body.

**Mucus**: A sticky secretion that traps pathogens in the nose, throat, and lungs.

**Phagocytes**: White blood cells (e.g., macrophages) that engulf and destroy pathogens.

**Antibody**: A protein produced by the immune system to neutralize specific antigens.

**Lymphocyte**: A type of white blood cell (e.g., B cells, T cells) critical to adaptive immunity.

**Hygiene**: Practices (e.g., handwashing) that maintain health and prevent disease spread.

**Antiseptic**: A substance applied to living tissue to prevent infection (e.g., iodine).

**Disinfectant**: A chemical used to kill pathogens on non-living surfaces (e.g., bleach).

**Quarantine**: Isolation of exposed individuals to prevent disease spread during incubation periods.

**Epidemiologist**: A scientist who studies disease patterns, causes, and control in populations.

**Communicable**: A disease that can be transmitted between organisms (synonymous with infectious).

**World Health Organisation (WHO)**: A United Nations agency coordinating international public health efforts.

**Immunisation**: The process of making a person immune to a disease, typically through vaccination
