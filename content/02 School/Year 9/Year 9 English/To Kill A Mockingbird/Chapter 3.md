# Summary of Chapter 3

- Burris Ewell (the new kid in Scout’s Year 1 class) = he is known to be the “filthiest” in town with “cootie’s” in his hair. 
- Little Chuck Little (is another student in Scout’s class, who is similar to Walter Cunningham)
- Calpurnia is like the mother figure in Scout’s life and runs house duties in their home. She gives Scout lectures and disciplines her too. For example:

> "First of all," he said, "if you can learn a simple trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view-"
> "Sir?"
> "-until you climb into his skin and walk around in it"
