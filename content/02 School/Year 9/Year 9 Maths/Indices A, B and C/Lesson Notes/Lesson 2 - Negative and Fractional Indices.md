# Negative Indices and Fractional Indices

## Negative Indices Law

The negatives indices law states that

$$ a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m} $$

When the exponent is negative, **reciprocate** it (flip it, so that $\frac{m}{n}$ becomes $\frac{n}{m}$ $\frac{1}{m}$ becomes $\frac{m}{1}$)  and remove the negative sign.

## Fractional Indices Law

The fractional indices law states that

$$a^{\frac{m}{n}}=\sqrt[n]{a^m}$$

An easier way to remember it is

$$a^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt[(2)]{a^{(1)}}$$

When the exponent is a **fraction**, it can be expressed as a **surd**:

> The **numerator** becomes the *exponent* of the pronumeral
>
> The **denominator** becomes *index* (the number just outside of the square root sign)
