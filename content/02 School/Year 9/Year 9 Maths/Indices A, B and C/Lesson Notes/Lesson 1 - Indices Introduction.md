# Parts of an Expression

eg. $5x^3+9$

$5$ is the **coefficient**

$x$ is the **base**

$3$ is the **power/exponent/index**

$9$ is the **constant term**

# Index Laws

## Multiplication Law

The multiplication law states that

$$ a^m\times a^n = a^{m+n} $$

When the **bases** are the same, you can **add** the exponents when multiplying the terms.

## Division Law

The division law states that

$$ a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n} $$

When the **bases** are the same, you can **subtract** the exponents when **dividing** the terms.

## Power of a Power Law

The power of a power law states that

$$ (a^m)^n = a^{mn} $$

When raising a **power** to another power, you **multiply** the exponents.

## Zero Exponent Law

The zero exponent law states that

$$ a^0=1, a\neq 0$$

Any base (except zero) raised to the power of zero equals one.
