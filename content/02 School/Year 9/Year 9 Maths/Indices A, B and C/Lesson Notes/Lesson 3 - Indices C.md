# Indices C

Surds are irrational

An irrational number means that it cannot be expressed as a fraction.

Perfect Squares:

## Surd Laws

### Multiplication of Surds

$$\sqrt{ a\times b }=\sqrt{ a }\times\sqrt{ b }$$

### Division of Surds

$$\sqrt{ \frac {a}{b} }=\frac{\sqrt{ a } }{\sqrt{ b }}$$

### Rationalising the Denominator

$$\frac{b}{\sqrt{ a }}=\frac{b}{\sqrt{ a }}\times\left( \frac{\sqrt{ a }}{\sqrt{ a }} \right)=\frac{b\sqrt{ a }}{a}$$

## Types of Surds

### Simple Surd

A surd that only has one term

$\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{ 6 }, \sqrt{ 3 }$ etc.

### Pure Surd

A surd that is completely irrational

$\sqrt{ 3 }, \sqrt{ 2 }, \sqrt{ 5 }$ etc.

### Similar Surd

The surds have the **same** common surd factor

$\sqrt{ 5 }, 3\sqrt{ 5 }, 5\sqrt{ 5 }$ etc.

### Mixed Surds

Surds that are not completely irrational and can be expressed as a product of a rational number and a rational number

$5\sqrt{ 3 }, 5\sqrt{ 6 }, 7\sqrt{ 10 }$ etc.

### Compound Surds

An expression which is the addition or subtraction of two or more surds

$3+2\sqrt{ 3 }, 7-\sqrt{ 10 }$ etc.

### Binomial Surds

A surd that is made of two or more surds

$(3\sqrt{ 2 }-3)(5+3\sqrt{ 2 })$ etc.
