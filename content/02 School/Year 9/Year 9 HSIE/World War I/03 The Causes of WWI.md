# The Causes of WWI

- The war had a lot to do with a shifting balance of power in Europe
- Tensions arose through competition for colonies and resources. 
- Some countries were becoming stronger than others.
- In order to protect themselves, nations built up their military forces and formed alliances with other countries

In time two major alliances stood opposed to each other.  These were:

| The Triple Alliance | The Triple Entente |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Germany             | Britian            |
| Austria-Hungary     | France             |
| Italy               | Russia             |

The Triple Alliance was a formal agreement between the three countries to help defend each other from attack. The agreement was renewed yearly until the war began.

The Triple Entente (a French word meaning ‘friendship’ or ‘understanding) ‘was an informal agreement between the three countries to help each other.

## Assassination and Alliances

The spark to the conflict was the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand

- Austria blamed Serbia for the assassination and planned to attack it.
- Russia supported Serbia as they considered them to be slavic people like the Russians and were, therefore, historically related to the Russian people.
- Due to the Triple Entente, Russia was joined by Britain and France
- Germany chose to defend its ally Austria.

So:

1. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.
2. Russia warned Austria-Hungary not to attack Serbia and mobilised its forces against Austria-Hungary.
3. Germany warned Russia not to mobilise its forces against Austria-Hungary. When Russia refused, Germany declared war on Russia.
4. As part of its plan to win the war, Germany then declared war on France (as an ally of Russia).
5. To avoid the heavy defences on the border with France, Germany invaded France through Belgium.
6. Britain then declared war on Germany in support of Belgium and France, and on Turkey because of her alliance with Germany.
7. In the following months and years, other countries declared war, including:

- Austria on Russia
- Japan on Germany
- Austria on Japan
- USA on Germany
- USA on Austria-Hungary

This was now truly a world war.

## What about Italy?

Despite being one of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary prior to the war, Italy sensed that it would be advantageous to join with the Entente. At the start of the war in 1914, they remained neutral, then the following year, in 1915, they joined the Entente.

"The Chain of Friendship", an American editorial cartoon depicting the supposed web of alliances, captioned, "If Austria attacks Serbia, Russia will fall upon Austria, Germany upon Russia, and France and England upon Germany.”

The two sides that fought in WW1 were:

| The Allies                                            | The Central Powers |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Britain (Including its Empire)                        | Germany            |
| France                                                | Austria-Hungary    |
| Russia                                                | Ottoman Turkey     |
| Belgium                                               | Bulgaria (1915)    |
| Italy (1915)                                          |                    |
| USA (1917)                                            |                    |
| Serbia, Portugal, Japan<br>& other minor participants |                    |

The Great War lasted from 28 July, 1914, when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia (one month after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand) and lasted until 11 November, 1918 when an armistice was declared between the warring parties.
