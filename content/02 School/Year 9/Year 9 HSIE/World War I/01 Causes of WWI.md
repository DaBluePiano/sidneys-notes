## Alliances

- By 1914 all the major powers were linked by a system of alliances.
- The alliances made it more likely that a war would start.
- Once started, the alliances made it more likely to spread.

## Nationalism

## Imperialism

- Princip was part of a group of six Bosnian assassins, members of a student revolutionary group that later became known as Young Bosnia. The political objective of the assassination was to free Bosnia and Herzegovina of Austria-Hungarian rule.
