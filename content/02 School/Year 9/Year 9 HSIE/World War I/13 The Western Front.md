# The Western Front

After the Gallipoli campaign, the Australian infantry divisions went on to fight some of the worst battles of the war. Between 1916 and late 1918, 295 000 Australian soldiers served on the Western Front. The Battle of the Somme in France in 1916 and the Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium in 1917 are the two battles that most represent the needless slaughter of young Australian men on the World War I battlefields.

## 1916: The Somme

The Battle of the Somme (July to November 1916) was another doomed attempt at breaking the stalemate on the Western Front. The plan was to launch a major attack on German lines in the Somme River valley. The assault would begin with an intense artillery bombardment of German defences.

Then, 1.2 million soldiers would advance in wave formations along a 40-kilometre front. The aim was to cut the Germans off from behind and make them so demoralised that they would surrender.

The Germans had weeks of forewarning through:

- overheard field telephone messages
- the movements of British reconnaissance aircraft
- the observations of their own pilots.

When the attack began on 1 July 1916:

- German defences were well prepared
- British mines went off too early and alerted the Germans that the attack was due to start
- British artillery fire failed to destroy the barbed wire protecting the German trenches.

When the soldiers advanced into no-man’s land, they advanced into a non-stop barrage of German machine-gun fire. They became easy targets as their attempts to pass through the German barbed wire only made them become more entangled in it. The Allied troops did not have the machine-gun power needed to respond effectively. On the first day, the Germans killed over 20 000 Allied troops and wounded 40 000.

The attack failed to achieve a large-scale breakthrough, and tactics focused instead on raids on specific enemy targets such as those at Fromelles and Pozières.

## Fromelles (Pronounced ‘From-ell’)

Australian soldiers’ first battle on the Western Front was the ill-fated Battle of Fromelles on 19–20 July 1916. Their goal was to divert German attention from the main action to the south and prevent them sending reinforcements there. Planning was rushed, the soldiers lacked experience and the distance across no-man’s land was as much as 400 metres in some sections. After seven hours of Allied artillery fire, German machine gunners, with the added advantage of being on higher ground, were well and truly ready when British and Australian troops began their attack in the evening of 19 July. By the early hours of 20 July, the 5th Australian Division had 5533 casualties and one of the greatest losses of Australian lives ever within a 24-hour period.![|443x432](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcRBA3v7_XbEdfQr7BeyXpcyoBFvpwEd6oLo9HwcxMUKKaTzllGOo0LXi6X5n1pzmZ-vYaPt2RfcokPT5fryHLgrYDwugSTCeALwbXu6Jp0p_kLl8JDu-lz5OaaWWLa9xv_Pq3z?key=FEn95qkq-7eGZuetfIoQeRPu)

## Pozières (Pronounced “Pozzie-air’)

A few days later, the First Australian Division had the task of capturing the German-held town of Pozières. This was achieved in a few hours on 23 July 1916, but it took another

seven weeks of horrific fighting against ongoing German artillery fire to consolidate the gain. By this time, three more Australian divisions had become involved.

In July 1916, there were 90 000 AIF soldiers serving on the Western Front. By the end of August 1916, there were 23 000 Australian casualties from the Somme battlefields — nearly as many as for the entire eight months at Gallipoli. By the end of the Somme campaign, the AIF had lost more than 32 000 soldiers, with an overall gain in land of about 10.5 kilometres. Neither the average Australian soldier nor the average British soldier had much faith in their military leaders after this.

| The assault at Pozières, continued the London officer, was one of the most difficult essayed since the offensive began. The Germans set their heart on retaining the village. Sir Douglas Haig’s order was that Pozières must be taken. When the word was given to charge the Australians swept across the approaches to the German lines. There was no shouting or battle-crying. Each Tom, Dick and Harry with teeth set firmly, went forth to slay in silence. When the German machine guns opened fire, the bullets whizzed in all directions . . . <br><br>Some crack German regiments were employed, but the Anzacs went for their men, and put in terrible bayonet work. After a fierce contest the Australians and New Zealanders obtained the upper hand . . . It was the most horrible night any soldiers ever experienced. By daybreak on Monday we had a firm footing in the village. ‘The fighting at Pozières,’ continued the London officer, ‘has proved that the Anzacs would face a wall of iron and go through it.’<br><br>  <br><br>Source 3 A news report on the attack on Pozières from the Sydney Morning Herald, 28 July 1916 |

## 1917: Passchendaele (Pronounced ‘Pashendarl’)

From mid to late 1917, two Anzac divisions took part in fighting in and around Ieper (Ypres) in Belgium. This was the third battle of Ieper, also known as the Battle of Passchendaele. The battle was part of a British attempt to break through the German lines towards the North Sea ports, where the German U-boats were berthed. There were 7000 Australian casualties during the initial attack in June.

In July 1917, the British resumed artillery shelling of German defences. The Germans had the advantage of higher ground and a wide view of their attackers’ movements. Over the next fourteen weeks, Allied troops made ten attempts to break through to Passchendaele. Men and equipment became bogged down in mud and flooded fields. General Haig insisted that the attack proceed. When his chief of staff visited the battlefield, he reportedly had tears in his eyes as he said, ‘Good God, did we really send men to fight in that?’ Overall, the Allied forces suffered 300 000 casualties; 38 000 were Australian.

[it is] not an exact representation of nature, and a picture is not a record of things in view . . . Regard your camera as an artist does his brush. Think that you hold a piece of apparatus worthy of the same possibilities as the artist . . . Your camera is but a piece of mechanical apparatus. You are its intellect.’<br><br>  <br><br>In 1917, as one of the AIF’s official war photographers in France and Belgium, Hurley took great risks to record the nature and impact of trench warfare. Frustrated that any one photograph could not convey the entirety of an event, he began to merge several negatives and create composite photos. In his view, ‘It is impossible to secure full effects of this bloody war without composite pictures. It’s unfair to our soldiers’.<br><br>  <br>![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcFEs0SdywY2cZ9SABztXh0nNyg86ICVaNqRD30OJNpcPUic49Xsev0nsFfNEqSZQc1FI-iPMixOenGn9U5zuJwllJaP07aCuiYJLY86-dMQpA01JkRelIGaXFHNK0nkGEbMo5a?key=FEn95qkq-7eGZuetfIoQeRPu)<br><br>War correspondent and historian C.E.W.
