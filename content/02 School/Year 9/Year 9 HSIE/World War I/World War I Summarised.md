# World War I

---

## The Origins of World War I

- **Root Causes**:
  - **Nationalism**: Aggressive patriotism fueled competition among European powers (e.g., France sought revenge for Alsace-Lorraine).
  - **Militarism**: Arms race between Germany and Britain (e.g., HMS *Dreadnought* in 1906) and army expansions.
  - **Alliances**:
    - **Triple Entente** (1907): Britain, France, Russia.
    - **Triple Alliance** (1882): Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy (later neutral).
  - **Imperialism**: Competition for colonies in Africa/Asia (e.g., British fears of German expansion).
  - **Assassination**: Archduke Franz Ferdinand killed by Gavrilo Princip (28 June 1914), triggering the July Crisis.
- **Key Events Leading to War**:
  - Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia for the assassination, issued an ultimatum (23 July 1914).
  - Russia mobilized in support of Serbia; Germany declared war on Russia (1 August) and France (3 August).
  - Germany invaded Belgium (Schlieffen Plan), prompting Britain to declare war (4 August).

## The Causes of WWI (MANIA)

1. **Militarism**:
   - Germany vs. Britain naval rivalry; rapid army expansions (e.g., Germany: 1.3m troops in 1880 → 5m in 1914).
2. **Alliances**:
   - Binding agreements turned regional conflicts into global wars.
3. **Nationalism**:
   - Slavic nationalism in Balkans (e.g., Serbia/Russia vs. Austria-Hungary).
4. **Imperialism**:
   - Scramble for colonies (e.g., British-German tensions in Africa).
5. **Assassination**:
   - Immediate trigger; Princip part of *Young Bosnia*, supported by Serbian nationalists.

## Australia’s Involvement in WWI

- **Enthusiasm for War**:
  - PM Andrew Fisher pledged support: "to the last man and last shilling."
  - 52,000 enlisted by December 1914; high physical standards lowered over time.
  - **Reasons for Enlistment**: Patriotism, adventure, peer pressure, higher wages (6 shillings/day).
- **Gallipoli Campaign (1915)**:
  - **Objective**: Secure Dardanelles to aid Russia; failed naval assault led to land invasion.
  - **ANZAC Landing** (25 April 1915):
    - Mistimed artillery; Turkish resistance underestimated.
    - **Conditions**: Heat, disease, flies, poor sanitation; 26,000 ANZAC casualties (10,000 deaths).
  - **Key Battles**:
    - **Lone Pine**: 2,300 Australian casualties; 7 Victoria Crosses awarded.
    - **The Nek**: 234 Australians killed in 45 minutes due to failed charges.
  - **Evacuation** (Dec. 1915): Minimal casualties; use of self-firing rifles to deceive Turks.
- **Western Front (1916–1918)**:
  - **Battle of the Somme** (1916): 20,000 Allied deaths on first day; Australians fought at Fromelles (5,533 casualties) and Pozières (23,000 casualties).
  - **Passchendaele** (1917): Mud, artillery, and 38,000 Australian casualties.
  - **1918 Offensive**: Lieutenant General John Monash’s tactics at Hamel (4 July) led to Allied breakthroughs.

## Trench Warfare

- **Structure**:
  - Three-line system (front, reserve, support trenches); zig-zag patterns to limit blast damage.
- **Conditions**:
  - Mud, lice, disease (e.g., trench foot), constant shelling.
  - **Weapons**: Machine guns, poison gas, artillery.

## The Changing Role of Women

- **Voluntary Work**:
  - **Red Cross**: Knitted socks, comfort boxes (e.g., 1.3 million pairs of socks by 1918).
  - **Australian Comforts Fund**: Sent luxury items to soldiers.
- **Paid Work**:
  - Workforce participation rose from 24% to 37%; roles in factories, clerical work.
  - **Limitations**: Low wages (half of men’s pay); seen as temporary replacements.

---

## The Conscription Debate

- **Referendums** (1916, 1917): Both rejected conscription.
  - **YES Arguments**: Support Britain, finish Gallipoli’s mission, patriotism.
  - **NO Arguments**: Violated freedom, class inequality, Irish opposition, union resistance.
- **Propaganda**:
  - **Pro-conscription**: "A Call from the Dardanelles" (guilt, duty).
  - **Anti-conscription**: "The Blood Vote" (fear of forced sacrifice).

---

## The Anzac Legend

- **Creation**:
  - **Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett’s reports** (May 1915): Highlighted bravery, mateship, and initiative.
  - **Charles Bean**: Promoted "Anzac spirit" in *The Anzac Book* (1916), omitting negatives like cowardice.
- **Criticisms**:
  - Ignores war’s futility, non-unique Australian traits, and pre-war nation-building (e.g., Federation).
  - **John Simpson**: Symbolized heroism but criticized as overhyped (English-born, short service).

## The Treaty of Versailles (1919)

- **Terms**:
  - **Territorial Losses**: Alsace-Lorraine to France; colonies surrendered.
  - **Military Restrictions**: 100,000 troops max; no airforce/tanks.
  - **Reparations**: £6.6 billion (equivalent to $2.6 trillion today).
  - **War Guilt Clause**: Germany blamed for the war.
- **Impact**:
  - Humiliated Germany, fueling resentment and economic collapse.
  - Redrew Europe (e.g., Poland, Czechoslovakia); League of Nations formed (failed without U.S. support).

---

## Key Statistics

- **Casualties**:
  - 9 million soldiers dead; 21 million wounded.
  - Australia: 60,000 dead (from 416,809 enlisted).
- **Propaganda**: Used to manipulate public opinion (e.g., "Hun" stereotypes, nationalism).

---

## Contestability and Debates

- **Schlieffen Plan**: Historians dispute its existence (e.g., Terence Zuber’s 2002 critique).
- **Anzac Legend**: Paul Keating criticized Gallipoli’s glorification (1992, 2008).
