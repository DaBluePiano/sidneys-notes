# Overview of World War 1

## Causes of World War I (M.A.N.I.A.)

- M - Militarism:
- Nations raced to build powerful armies/navies (arms race).
- Germany and Britain especially competed in naval development (e.g., HMS Dreadnought).
- War was seen as inevitable and even desirable.
- A - Alliances:
- Europe divided into two alliances:
- Triple Alliance: Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy.
- Triple Entente: Britain, France, Russia.
- Alliances meant local conflicts could trigger a wider war.
- Italy switched sides in 1915 to join the Entente.
- N - Nationalism:
- Extreme patriotism led to distrust and rivalry.
- Slavic nationalism (esp. Serbia) created tension with Austria-Hungary.
- National pride often prioritized over diplomacy.
- I - Imperialism:
- Competition for colonies, resources, and trade, especially in Africa and Asia.
- Created rivalry and increased global tension.
- A - Assassination:
- Archduke Franz Ferdinand (heir to Austro-Hungarian throne) assassinated in Sarajevo (June 1914) by Gavrilo Princip.
- Set off a chain reaction through alliances, leading to full-scale war.

## 🔗 The Alliance Chain Reaction

- Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.
- Russia mobilised to defend Serbia.
- Germany declared war on Russia, then on France.
- Germany invaded Belgium; Britain entered the war.
- Eventually, global involvement led to a world war.

## 🛡️ The War Fronts

- Western Front:
- Trench warfare created stalemates (France/Belgium).
- Battles like Somme & Passchendaele saw massive casualties for minimal gains.
- Technology (machine guns, barbed wire) favoured defence.
- Eastern Front:
- Battles between Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia.
- Ended in 1917 with Russia’s withdrawal following revolution.
- Middle East/Gallipoli:
- Anzacs landed at Gallipoli (April 1915); campaign failed due to poor planning and strong Turkish defence.
- Evacuation in December 1915 marked end of campaign.
- Harsh conditions and strategic failures shaped the Anzac legend.

## 🇦🇺 Australia's Involvement

- Declared war alongside Britain in August 1914.
- Massive voluntary enlistment driven by:
- Loyalty to Britain.
- Sense of duty and masculinity.
- Desire for adventure, peer pressure, and better pay.
- Enlistment declined after Australians heard news of the reality of war, such as the human cost of the Gallipoli campaign.
- Over 300,000 Australians served on the Western Front and Gallipoli.
- Notable battles: Gallipoli, Fromelles, Pozières, Hamel.
