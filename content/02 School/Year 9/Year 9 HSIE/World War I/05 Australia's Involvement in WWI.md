# Australia’s Involvement in WWI

As Britain readied itself to declare war on Germany in August 1914, future Australian Prime Minister Andrew Fisher promised that 'Australia will stand behind our Mother Country to help and defend her to our last man and our last shilling'. Great Britain's war became Australia's war too. Fisher's comment reflected the attitudes of many Australians, who assumed Britain's war to be a just and noble cause in which Australians could demonstrate their loyalty to the 'mother country'. Like people of all nations, they believed that the war would be short, with the victorious troops home by Christmas, recounting tales of their glorious exploits.

## Enthusiasm for War

Pro-British war fever was the dominant emotion in most Australian cities following Britain's declaration of war on Germany on 4 August 1914. Newspapers, competing with one another to demonstrate their loyalty to the mother country, forecast countless heroic deeds against the hated enemy. This enthusiasm was especially significant because the Defence Act 1903 (Cwlth) limited the Australian Army to service in defence of Australia and only on Australian territory. Australia needed to attract volunteers to serve in an army outside Australia. This restriction did not apply to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), which participated in war under the command of Britain's Royal Navy.

Recruitment began on 10 August 1914. Within days, 40 000 men had volunteered. This was double the number the government had offered to send to Britain. By November, the first group of volunteers, including a large group of the Light Horse, had left for training in Egypt. By December 1914, 52 000 men had volunteered to serve in the army, to be known as the Australian Imperial Force (the AIF), which, when combined with New Zealanders, would form the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (the Anzacs). Three thousand men served with the Australian Flying Corps (AFC). With troops off to the battlefront, the Australian government reinforced its commitment to compulsory military training for all males between the ages of 12 and 25.

Initially, with plenty of volunteers, the Army could set high physical standards. Many men who would normally have been considered fit and healthy failed to meet those standards and were turned away. In 1914, the minimum height for acceptance into the AIF was 168 centimetres. By late 1914, recruitment officials had reduced this to 163 centimetres and by 1917 to 152 centimetres.

## Why Australians Enlisted

Support for the 'mother' country was not the only reason for Australian men's rush to enlist. 

**Other reasons included:**
- fear that the opportunity for 'adventure' would pass them by if they did not enlist quickly
- the desire to avoid the disapproval of peers and young women. Some women showed their disapproval of men who were not in uniform by giving them a white feather, a symbol of cowardice.
- the chance to earn higher wages (six shillings a day compared to one shilling a day for British soldiers)
- men's feeling that it was their ' duty' to enlist
- hatred of the 'Hun' (insulting name for Germans).
