# The Schlieffen Plan

Increased tensions among the major powers led them to prepare strategies to be used if war broke out. Germany developed, and continued to update, a plan known as the Schlieffen Plan; France developed the war plan known as Plan 17.

## Contestability: the Schlieffen Plan

In 2002, Terence Zuber’s book Inventing the Schlieffen Plan: German War Planning 1871–1914 began a huge debate among military historians about the Schlieffen Plan. Zuber based his work on documents that had become available from German archives only in the 1990s. He concluded that what historians have accepted for nearly a century as ‘the Schlieffen Plan’ never really existed. This would mean that the traditional view — that, to avoid a war of two fronts, Germany had to attack France once Russia had mobilised — was incorrect. According to Zuber, German officers invented the  Schlieffen Plan in the 1920s as a means of excusing their failed strategies. Other historians argue that the Schlieffen Plan existed and that the Germans implemented a modified version of it when war broke out. Debate continues with, as yet, no consensus.
