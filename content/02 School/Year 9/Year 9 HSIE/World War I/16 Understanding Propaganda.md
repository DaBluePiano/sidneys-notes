# Understanding Propaganda

Propaganda is information, ideas or argument used to further a cause or damage an opponent’s cause. Its purpose is to influence the audience to adopt a certain attitude or take a certain action.

Propaganda expresses information that supports a particular point of view — often a political idea — and does this in a way that will encourage an emotional response, rather than an objective or intellectual response.

In World War I, the Australian government used propaganda to gain and maintain support for the war and to encourage enlistment. Groups from both sides of the conscription debate used propaganda posters to influence people’s vote. Posters were a common means of spreading propaganda.

Techniques included:

- portraying the enemy as barbaric, non-human and incapable of justice or compassion, often through the use of stereotyping to make everything about the enemy unacceptable
- giving people a direct order, such as ‘Join Up today!’, so that people felt that someone in authority was telling them what to do
- appealing to feelings of nationalism and patriotism
- suggesting negative/unacceptable ideas in which opponents supposedly believed
- simplifying an idea to make it attractive or acceptable
- projecting a positive image and suggesting that the target audience can acquire this image by following the order the poster provides
- choosing words and phrases that convey positive concepts, such as ‘support’.
