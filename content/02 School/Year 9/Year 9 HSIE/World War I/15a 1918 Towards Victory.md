1918: Towards Victory

Following Russian surrender in late 1917, Germany transferred more divisions to the Western Front. In anticipation of the arrival of US troops to fight on the Allied side, Germany launched a Spring Offensive in the Somme. After initial success, war-weary and poorly supplied German forces, facing sustained and well-coordinated Allied defence, failed to achieve a breakthrough.

4 July: the Battle of Hamel

1918 provided opportunities for new Allied commanders to use tactics and strategies that would make the most effective use of new technology. The Battle of Hamel on 4 July 1918 was the forerunner of the model for Allied attacks for the duration of the war. In 93 minutes the Anzacs, under the command of Lieutenant General John Monash, achieved their objective of capturing the town of Hamel. This was a key goal in facilitating the defence of Amiens and launching a counter-offensive against the Germans.

The success showed the benefits of Monash’s meticulous planning: allowing time for his orders to be circulated and fully understood, camouflaging his intentions with skilful use of diversionary tactics, and starting the operation under cover of darkness. Most importantly, he successfully coordinated the infantry with every form of weaponry and technology available — artillery and machine gun barrages, wireless, tanks and aeroplanes, with the latter two used for the transport of heavy weaponry as well as in combat. The attack conserved the energy of his troops and minimised their vulnerability to the enemy having advance notice of their plans.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc4aO2G6F_284UqIHO4JcAe5VNVCUvqFnKliKpff5vCJ5y2V30AJvjZroFuAs2LYdBJtoGls8QHL8NhZOA8l4c0jm05506YZSz-X00CP3-vjndb4kTP__uL1wYM9F2ALjN6hkz7VQ?key=WGqXbbfR4TYUaS2obZNRIQ)

The 100 days

On 8 August 1918, British, Canadian and Australian soldiers launched a massive offensive resulting in what German General Erich Ludendorff called der schwarze Tag — ‘the black day’ of the German army. Over the next 100 days, Allied forces relentlessly attacked German forces and, by early October, had broken through the entire depth of the defence system the Germans called the Hindenburg Line. With its army in retreat and its soldiers’ morale low, the German High Command asked the German government to obtain an armistice.

The armistice and ceasefire that ended the war came into effect at 11 am on 11 November 1918 — over four years after the war had started.
