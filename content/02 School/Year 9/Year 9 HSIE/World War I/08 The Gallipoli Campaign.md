# The Gallipoli Campaign

## Reasons for Attacking Turkey

By Christmas of 1914 1 million soldiers had been killed, Russia had lost its supply route through the Dardanelles and was threatening to surrender.

Great Britain’s Winston Churchill believed the navy could be used to defeat Turkey and thus resupply Russia.  

His goals were;

- To knock Turkey out of the war
- Re-open the supply route to Russia
- Open a new front against Germany’s ally Austria – Hungary

The naval assault of February, March 1915 failed.  So it was decided to attempt a series of landings along the Gallipoli peninsula to take out the forts and thus allow the navy to break through to Istanbul.

## The Gallipoli Campaign

- Britain decided after the failed naval attack, to make a landing and use soldiers to attack.
- The invasion began on the 25th April 1915 (ANZAC Day). The British and French forces landed at a point in the south of the Dardanelles, while the ANZACs landed at a point further north. The job of the ANZACs was to stop the expected retreat of the Turks.
- Unfortunately, the ANZACs decided to “dig-in” rather than continue to advance into Turkish territory. This gave Turkey plenty of time to organise a defence.
- As a result, the Gallipoli campaign became a trench war, with neither side gaining any advantage.

## Conditions in the Trenches

By the middle of 1915, the weather had become hot and there were plagues of disease-carrying flies and fleas. Supply ships brought in water from Egypt but there was never enough.

By October, the weather had turned to bitter cold, mud and ice. Troops who arrived in peak physical condition soon suffered from illnesses such as diarrhoea, dysentery and gastroenteritis. Toilets were open pits.

Turkish soldiers, as close as 30 metres in some places, kept the ANZACs under constant fire. Consequently, corpses lay rotting in no-man’s land and wounded men lay for hours awaiting medical attention.

## Lone Pine and the Nek

British Commander, Sir Ian Hamilton, tried to break the deadlock at Gallipoli by attacking Turkish strongholds at Lone Pine and the Nek. The intention was to draw attention away from the British troops landing further south, at Suvla Bay and allied attacks at Sari Bair.

LONE PINE

- Australian troops emerged from secret tunnels close to the Turkish line.
- Australian troops were gunned down as they charged the Turkish trenches.
- Despite the odds, the ANZACs succeeded in taking Lone Pine but at a huge cost.

The NEK

- Hundreds of men from the 3rd Light Horse “went over the top” of their trenches in four suicidal charges against the Turks, only 27 metres away.
- The bombardment that was supposed to clear the trenches largely overshot its target and there was a seven minute gap between the end of the bombardment and the charge, giving the Turks both warning and time to prepare.
- Communication was disrupted, so a fourth wave left the trenches when they didn’t need to.
- This attack was a failure. 234 men died in 45 minutes.

## Evacuation of Gallipoli

- Campaign leader, Sir Ian Hamilton gave optimistic reports to the British Government despite strategists beginning to realise that they had little chance of beating the Turks at Gallipoli.
- Journalist Keith Murdoch smuggled a letter reporting the true situation to the British Prime Minister.
- Hamilton was replaced by General Sir Charles Munro who advised evacuation.
- They began evacuation in early December.
- They devised a number of tricks to hide the withdrawal:
	- Australian troops remained quiet for long periods of time.  When the Turks appeared to find out what was happening they opened fire. 
	- They organised a method whereby water dripped into a pan attached to a trigger enabled a gun to fire by itself.
- By 19th December the evacuation was complete, with only 2 casualties.  By this time, there were 26,000 casualties among the ANZAC troops, including 10,000 deaths.
