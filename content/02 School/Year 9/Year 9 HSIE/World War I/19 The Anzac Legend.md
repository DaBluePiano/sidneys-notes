## Creating the Anzac Legend

The Gallipoli campaign and the Anzac legend that emerged from it have had a significant impact on ideas about Australia’s national identity. Although a military defeat, reports of Australians at Gallipoli have had a profound effect on how Australians view themselves. For many people, the participation of Australian soldiers in the Gallipoli campaign symbolises Australia’s coming of age as a nation and demonstrates the qualities that characterise Australians. British war correspondent Ellis Ashmead- Bartlett (1881–1931) helped to create this legend with his newspaper report on the Gallipoli landing.

Ashmead-Bartlett ‘observed’ the landing from a battleship some distance away and did not arrive at Gallipoli until 9.30 pm on 25 April.<br><br>  <br><br>The Australians, who were about to go into action for the first time in trying circumstances, were cheerful, quiet and confident. There was no sign of nerves nor of excitement . . . the boats had almost reached the beach when a party of Turks, entrenched ashore, opened a terrible fusillade with rifles and a Maxim [machine gun] . . .<br><br>  <br><br>The Australians rose to the occasion. Not waiting for orders or for the boats to reach the beach, they sprang into the sea and, forming a sort of rough line, rushed at the enemy trenches.<br><br>Their magazines were not charged, so they just went in with cold steel. It was over in a minute. The Turks in the first trench were either bayoneted or they ran away and their Maxim was captured.<br><br>  <br><br>Then the Australians found themselves facing an almost perpendicular cliff of loose sandstone . . . Somewhere, half-way up, the enemy had a second trench, strongly held . . . Here was a tough proposition to tackle in the darkness, but those colonials, practical above all else, went about it in a practical way . . . They stopped for a few minutes . . . got rid of their packs, and charged their magazines.<br><br>  <br><br>Then this race of athletes proceeded to scale the cliffs without responding to the enemy’s fire. They lost some men, but did not worry. In less than a quarter of an hour the Turks were out of their second position, either bayoneted or fleeing . . .<br><br>  <br><br>The courage displayed by the wounded Australians will never be forgotten . . . Though many were shot to bits, without hope of recovery, their cheers resounded throughout the night . . . They were happy because they knew they had been tried for the first time and not found wanting . . . There has been no finer feat in this war than this sudden landing in the dark and storming the heights . . .<br><br>Argus, 8 May 1915.|

This was the first report on the landing that Australian newspapers published. It found an appreciative and ready audience among those who:

- were concerned about Australian soldiers’ reputation for being ‘undisciplined’, gained while they were training in Egypt
- feared that Australians might have behaved poorly in their first military engagement
- wanted to see Australian soldiers at least equal the efforts of British and Canadian troops (who had performed well in France)
- were looking for a positive national identity for Australia that was distinct from that of Great Britain
- were concerned about how people of other nationalities would judge Australia in the world arena.

Australians at home responded enthusiastically to this praise. Enlistment figures for June 1915 (12 505) were nearly double the figures for April. In July, they soared to 36 575 — nearly a 300 per cent increase on the month before.

People used extracts from Ashmead-Bartlett’s report in fund-raising brochures, theatre playbills and in a booklet that the New South Wales Department of Education distributed to schoolchildren. One film-maker used it as the basis of a 1915 film entitled The Hero of the Dardanelles (filmed at Tamarama Beach, Sydney). One woman, in a letter distributed widely among soldiers, described her feeling on reading Ashmead-Bartlett’s account as ‘pride’, ‘exultation’ and the sentiment ‘Thank God, I am an Australian’.

From this time onward, reports of what Australians were doing at Gallipoli took precedence over reports of what the British or anyone else was doing. Ashmead-Bartlett became a media celebrity and people valued and enjoyed his reports.

Ashmead-Bartlett’s article inspired the creation of a framework for interpreting events and experiences on the Gallipoli Peninsula and identifying the characteristic features of the ‘true Australian’ — heroism, mateship, initiative, a disregard for authority, athletic ability, endurance and a cheeky sense of humour. Australia’s official war correspondent, Charles Bean, reinforced this image through his own reports from Gallipoli, through his 1916 best seller, The Anzac Book — a book of soldiers’ stories, poems and artwork — and ultimately in the 12 volumes of his Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–18. Bean was conscious of doing this and careful to reject any submissions to The Anzac Book that did not fit within this formula.

Bean as editor and image maker’ in Historical Studies, vol. 21, no. 84, April, pages 381 and 382–3<br><br>  <br><br>[H]e excluded from The Anzac Book anything unpleasant which could not be treated humorously. The dirt, the flies, the cold, and the monumental discomforts of Gallipoli are all documented in The Anzac Book with a grim humour, but the danger, the brutality, the suffering, the waste of life, and the dehumanising effects of warfare are conspicuously absent . . .<br><br>  <br><br>In a revealing passage in his diary Bean noted how few men really wanted to fight, how some had to be forced into action at pistol point, how many wanted to run away (and many did) and some would ‘shoot their fingers off to escape from the front’. No trace of this reluctance was allowed to appear in The Anzac Book. Two good sketches were rejected even though they make fun of the coward and the malingerer, presumably because Bean’s ‘Anzac’ was neither of these; in embracing all Australian soldiers as ‘Anzacs’ in the souvenir, he was not prepared to admit to such behaviour . . .<br><br>  <br><br>In September 1915, Bean committed to his diary a lengthy appraisal of the Australian soldier in which he acknowledged that fear, cowardice and reluctance were the ‘true side of war’, but he added: ‘I wonder if anyone would believe me outside the army’.<br><br>  <br><br>malingerer: someone who pretends illness or  disability, especially in order to avoid duty or work|

## Contestability: Debating the Anzac Legend

From the late twentieth century onwards, Australian governments have again promoted the Anzac legend’s concept of Gallipoli as Australia’s ‘baptism of fire’ and the Australian soldier at Gallipoli as the personification of Australia’s national identity. Some historians believe that enthusiasm for Gallipoli and the Anzac legend is distorting the reality of our history. They feel that Anzac Day and the Anzac legend have become expressions of emotion, sentimentality and nostalgia that deny the reality of soldiers’ wartime experiences and undermine recognition of more significant events and values in Australia’s history.

In his 1992 Anzac Day address, then Prime Minister Keating declared: ‘Legends . . . define us to ourselves. But they should not stifle us . . . constrain our growth, or restrict us when we have to change’. In October 2008, he delivered a speech expressing his view that Australians should not see Gallipoli as the place where Australia was ‘born’ or ‘redeemed’ (see source 3).

Dragged into service by the imperial government in an ill conceived and poorly executed campaign, we were cut to ribbons and dispatched. And none of it in the defence of Australia. Without seeking to simplify the then bonds of empire and the implicit sense of obligation, or to diminish the bravery of our own men, we still go on as though the nation was born again or even was redeemed there. An utter and complete nonsense.<br><br>  <br><br>For these reasons I have never been to Gallipoli and I never will.|

## The ‘man with the donkey’

Private John Simpson Kirkpatrick (1892–1915) was an Englishman who had lived in Australia since 1910 after deserting his position in the merchant navy. Motivated by the hope of getting back to England, he enlisted in the AIF in August 1914 under the name ‘John Simpson’. He ended up at Anzac Cove. Simpson’s actions there were mentioned in official reports and became part of a 1916 book entitled Glorious Deeds of Australasians in the Great War. This was propaganda, which greatly exaggerated what Simpson had done and singled him out as a hero at a time when Australia needed new recruits.

Simpson served 24 days at Anzac Cove. He was meant to serve as a stretcher-bearer transporting seriously wounded men from the front lines back down to Anzac Cove. Instead, he chose to work alone, with a donkey, delivering water as he made his way up the heights above the beach, through the dangerous Shrapnel and Monash gullies to bring the wounded back down on his donkey. He and the two wounded he was transporting were shot dead in Monash Gully on 19 May 1915.

For many people, Simpson typifies the man of the Anzac legend. Others argue that he was English, a reluctant recruit and someone whose assistance to relatively few and not seriously wounded men, while noteworthy, did not make him a hero.

## Historians’ Criticisms

Historians who criticise the Anzac legend put forward the following points:

- The legend ignores the reality of Australia’s huge death toll fighting a war fought on foreign soil in the interests of Great Britain.
- Australians invaded Turkey and killed people defending their own land.
- Soldiers of all armies experienced mateship and many of the other values celebrated in the Anzac legend; these are not uniquely Australian.
- The fact that someone is heroic does not necessarily mean that they are morally right.
- World War I caused more division than nation-building in Australian society.
- At war’s end, Australia still had a British head of state and the British government still decided Australia’s foreign policy
- The Anzac legend ignores other important influences on Australia’s national identity — traditions of a ‘fair go’ and egalitarianism; support for economic, gender, racial and social equality; belief in democracy.
- Australia’s history before 1915, Federation, campaigns for social and political rights, and migration have also played significant roles in building the Australian nation.
- To say that wars are what make nations come of age is to accept the value system of the pre–World War I writers who sold a message that war was worthwhile.

|Source 5 An extract from historians Henry Reynolds’ and Marilyn Lake’s epilogue ‘Moving on’ in What’s wrong with Anzac?, 2010, page 167<br><br>  <br><br>Like many Australians who are concerned with the homage paid to the Anzac spirit and associated militarisation of our history, we are concerned with the way history is used to define our national heritage and national values. We suggest that Australians might look to alternative national traditions that gave pride of place to equality of opportunity and the pursuit of social justice: the idea of a living wage and sexual and racial equality. In the myth of Anzac, military achievements are exalted above civilian ones; events overseas are given priority over Australian developments; slow and patient nation-building is eclipsed by the bloody drama of battle; action is exalted above contemplation. The key premise of the Anzac legend is that nations and men are made at war. It is an idea that had currency a hundred years ago. Is it not now time to cast it aside?|
