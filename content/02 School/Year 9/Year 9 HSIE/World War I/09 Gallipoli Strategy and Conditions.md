# Gallipoli Strategy and Conditions

## The British Plan to Break the Stalemate

By Christmas 1914, one million Allied soldiers had died on the Western Front. The British government had begun searching for a way to break the stalemate. This meant relieving Turkish pressure on Russia, who, having lost access to its supply route through the Dardanelles, was threatening to surrender. If that happened, Germany would be able to transfer its troops from the Eastern to the Western Front and possibly defeat the Allies.

Winston Churchill, the civilian head of the British Navy, believed the Allies could win the war by using warships to attack and defeat Germany’s new ally, Turkey. The goals were to:

- force Turkey out of the war
- re-open the supply route to Russia
- open up a new front from which to attack Germany’s other main ally, Austria–Hungary
- move on to defeat Germany on the Western Front.

The first plan was to move British and French battleships through the Dardanelles and capture Turkey’s capital at that time, Istanbul (which Westerners called Constantinople). The naval assaults in February and March 1915 failed as mines and shellfire inflicted severe damage on British and French ships. British military authorities then decided to instead attempt a series of land invasions at various points along the Gallipoli Peninsula. The attackers would comprise British, Anzac and French troops. They would use infantry (ground troops) to destroy the forts and mobile artillery that protected the Dardanelles Strait and threatened the British and French fleets.

## Gallipoli: the Nature of Warfare

### The Landing

The invasion began on 25 April 1915 with British and French forces landing at beaches S, V, W, X and Y around Cape Helles and also on the opposite shore of the Dardanelles. The Anzacs were to land at Gaba Tepe and Ari Burnu and prevent Turkish troops retreating from the south and Turkish reinforcements arriving from the north.

The campaign began badly because:

- the failed naval bombardment had alerted the Turks to the likelihood of a land attack
- the Turks then had six weeks’ advance warning to prepare their defences
- by the time British and Anzac troops landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula, the Turks, under German General Liman von Sanders, had organised reinforcements, strengthened defences, laid mines, constructed trenches and established themselves on the high ground around both sides of the Gallipoli Peninsula and further inland
- Allied leaders missed opportunities and underestimated the Turks’ military capabilities and determination.

### Contestability: Myth and Reality at Anzac Cove

At 4.30 am on 25 April 1915, 16 000 Anzac troops began landing under cover of darkness at a tiny beach, later known as Anzac Cove. They were two kilometres north of the original intended position at Gaba Tepe.

Australian letters and diary entries from the time, and secondary accounts in the nearly 100 years since, record troops leaving their landing craft to face an unrelenting barrage of Turkish machine-gun fire. They describe Turkish forces at both ends of the beach and at the top of its steep cliffs ready and waiting to gun down the invaders. The increased availability of Turkish sources (such as messages, signals and military reports) in the last few years is providing information that supports a different version of events. In particular, Turkish sources indicate that it was unlikely that Turkish troops were either expecting invaders to land at Anzac Cove or that, at the time of the landing, they were retaliating with machine guns:

- Turkish forces were deployed in small numbers at posts along the 60-kilometre coastline of the Gallipoli Peninsula. Their role was to report landings and delay invaders as long as possible. Reserves waited in central locations inland, ready to move once the landing spots were known, but could not arrive until some hours later. 
- There were only somewhere between 90 and 250 Turkish troops at the cove itself.
- There was a severe shortage of machine guns throughout the Turkish army.
- It was only when reinforcements arrived, around 7.30–8.30 am, that the Turks began using machine guns against their Anzac enemies.

No Australian accounts mention anyone seeing a Turkish machine gun, and there are no records of Australian troops capturing any when they gained higher ground later in the day. Some military historians believe that Australian casualties would have been much higher had the Turks been using machine guns early in the day.

Historians have come up with a number of hypotheses to explain why Australians might have incorrectly recorded being under enemy machine-gun fire:

- Some may have purposely tried to increase the sense of danger and threat that they encountered in their first experience of enemy fire.
- Some may have repeated rumours that what they heard was machine-gun fire.
- Even experienced soldiers cannot always tell the difference between heavy and rapid rifle fire and machine-gun fire.
- Any machine guns they did actually hear may have been their own.

As this example shows, Turkish sources have already led historians to question traditional accounts of the Gallipoli landing. Increased efforts to access and translate more of these in the lead-up to the 2015 Gallipoli centenary should open up more areas of debate and lead to a greater depth of understanding of all aspects of the Gallipoli campaign.

### April–August 1915

The Anzacs initially began to head for the cliffs and their first-day objectives — Hill 971, the Third Ridge and MalTepe Hill. Possibly as early as 6 am, Australian commanders ordered the Second Brigade to abandon this offensive and instead to provide support for troops on the right flank, who were supposedly under threat from Turkish reinforcements. Troops then began to dig in at the Second Ridge.

As more and more Turkish reserves arrived, the Anzacs lost the opportunity that had existed for them to make significant advances into Turkish territory in the first three or four hours after their arrival. By digging in instead of continuing to advance against the vastly outnumbered Turks, the Anzacs ended up on the defensive. By nightfall of the first day, the Anzacs had failed to reach their first-day objectives.

They had advanced only about 900 metres at a cost of about 2000 casualties, including 621 dead. Over the next week, another 27 000 soldiers landed at Anzac Cove, where they tried to maintain control of the beach and construct trenches — all under the constant barrage of Turkish fire from distances as close as 30 metres and with little chance of regaining the initiative lost on the first day.

Soldiers armed with entrenching tools and sandbags hastily constructed the trenches and dugouts that would provide them with some protection. The task was difficult because the men mainly had to lie on their stomachs, using the entrenching tool without its handle.

Standing up to dig normally would have made them easy targets for the Turks. Over the following weeks, dugouts appeared all over the hillsides above Anzac Cove.

These were the places where the Anzacs ate, slept, wrote letters home, darned holes in their socks, smoked cigarettes and waited until they were called to active duty.

### May 1915

On 19 May 1915, 42 000 Turks advanced in an attempt to break through Anzac lines. They were unsuccessful and both sides paid a huge toll in the number of dead and wounded. The Turks and the Anzacs agreed to stop fighting for a few hours so they could bury their dead and collect the wounded from no-man’s land.

After a month of continual fighting and ceaseless noise, the sudden tranquillity seemed unreal … It was a welcome chance to stretch without fear of being shot. For the first time in many weeks, men could stand and survey the whole landscape. It was also a unique opportunity to meet the enemy. Men stepped up to the ceasefire line and swapped smiles, photographs, cigarettes and small gifts with each other. An Australian ambulance officer found the Ottomans ‘peaceful-looking men, stolid in type and of the peasant class mostly. We fraternised with them and gave them cigarettes and tobacco …’.

Shallow graves were excavated and the dead were buried where they lay. Mercifully, the day was cool, but it was a vile task nonetheless … [An] Australian felt eternally grateful to the

Ottoman medico who gave him pieces of scented wool to block his nostrils. Before the day was through, some four thousand bodies had been buried. At 4.30 pm, as arranged, the men climbed back down into their trenches … At 4.45 pm, a single shot rang out. Soon, the chatter of rifle fire returned to its normal level.

In June and July 1915, the main fighting involved British attacks — for limited gains — and Turkish counter attacks in the Cape Helles area. Both sides suffered the high casualties that were a feature of trench warfare.

### Living Conditions

Conditions at Gallipoli tested everyone’s endurance. By mid-year, the weather had become hot and there were plagues of disease-carrying flies and fleas. Supply ships brought in water from Egypt, but there was never enough. By October, soldiers were beginning to experience the bitter cold, mud and ice that were characteristic of a Turkish winter.

Source 7 An extract from the writings of author Ion Idriess, describing life at Gallipoli

I wrapped my overcoat over the tin and gouged out the flies, then spread the biscuit, held my hand over it and drew the biscuit out of the coat. But a lot of flies flew into my mouth and beat about inside. I nearly howled with rage.

Quoted in B. Gammage, The Broken Years: Australian Soldiers in the Great War, ANU, Canberra, 1974.

Troops who had arrived in peak physical condition soon suffered dysentery, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis and infestations of lice. It was virtually impossible to keep clean. Toilets were open pits. Corpses lay rotting in no-man’s land between the opposing trenches because it was unsafe to try to retrieve them for burial. Wounded men lay for hours awaiting medical attention. During some weeks in the Gallipoli campaign, as many as 20 per cent of the men were sick from diseases relating to poor hygiene.

Turkish soldiers, as close as 30 metres in some places, kept the Anzacs under constant threat with hand grenades, sniper fire, mortar bombs and shell blasts. The casualty rate was generally 23 per cent. It was difficult to escape either physically or psychologically from the war.
