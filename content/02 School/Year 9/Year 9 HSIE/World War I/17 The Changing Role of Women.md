# The Changing Role of Women

Australian women did not have military and economic equality with men. Australia did not need women to replace men in the paid workforce as desperately as did countries like Germany and Britain. While women in those countries took on ‘men’s work’, Australian women’s main wartime work was in volunteer work and in poorly paid traditionally ‘female’ roles. The Australian government refused women roles that many would have liked as members of auxiliary units attached to the armed forces. Some women worked in non-fighting roles providing medical services near the war front.

## Voluntary Work

Lady Helen Munro-Ferguson, wife of the Governor-General, helped form the Australian Branch of the British Red Cross Society. She became its first president. The organisation’s patriotic focus and links with the social elite attracted many middle-class women, and significant donations from groups such as the Australian Jockey Club. Women attended working bees where, over the period of the war, they produced thousands of items of clothing for the soldiers abroad. The Red Cross also sent food parcels to Australian prisoners of war and provided assistance to families by establishing a Wounded and Missing Inquiry Bureau.

The Australian Comforts Fund (ACF) was the other key organisation for volunteer work. Women officially established it in 1916 by joining together similar organisations from each state. The ACF provided ‘comfort boxes’, which contained the ‘luxury’ food, clothing or other items that went beyond the basics supplied by the AIF. These included such things as:

- cakes and puddings
- biscuits, condensed milk and sugar
- cigarettes, tobacco and matches
- chewing gum
- Handkerchiefs
- writing materials
- Newspapers
- extra clothing
- messages of support.

In keeping with its motto, ‘Keep the Fit man Fit’ the ACF helped prevent trench foot by ensuring that soldiers, who had no washing facilities in the trenches, had an adequate supply of dry socks. Every few weeks, organisers sent 10 000 pairs of hand-knitted socks to the men overseas — each pair representing about ten hours of labour. By late 1918, Australian women had knitted 1 354 328 pairs of socks for the ACF.

Other important voluntary organisations were Sydney’s Soldiers’ Sock Fund, which sent 21 000 pairs of socks overseas each year and Adelaide’s Cheer-Up society, which helped organise food, concerts and gifts for soldiers.

Women’s voluntary work also supported the shipping costs of these organisations. They raised funds by making and selling cakes, running button days, fetes and street stalls, and by organising and participating in door-knock appeals. Voluntary work enabled some middle class women to develop skills in fundraising, organisation, management, and collection and distribution that they might not have gained otherwise.

## The AWSC

In late 1916, hundreds of women joined the newly-formed Australian Women’s Service Corps (AWSC). They wanted to prepare for a more active war role — performing noncombatant tasks at the battle front as ambulance drivers, cooks or hospital orderlies. They wanted work that would release the ‘able-bodied men who are now performing these duties’ for active military service. The AWSC also conducted basic military training for its members. The Defence Department refused to take these women seriously.

## The Paid Workforce

Women’s participation in the paid workforce rose from 24 per cent in 1914 to 37 per cent in 1918. Women found their war work largely restricted to traditionally ‘female’ areas of work in the food, clothing, footwear, printing and textile industries. They also continued to work as shop assistants, in office work, in teaching and as nurses.

The factory was well ventilated and well lit and this, along with the latest machinery, made it a ‘model’ for modern production methods.

Whenever women replaced men in the workplace, it was only as part of a ‘reserve’ labour force. This meant that people believed women had a short-term place in the workforce rather than a long-term right to a position there. Some women took temporary jobs in the police force, in farming, in factories and in small businesses. Clerical work was popular, with about 10 000 women undertaking this form of employment during the war. Unions feared that if women did ‘men’s work’ at female pay rates, they would threaten men’s jobs or force men to accept lower wages. Society expected that when the war ended, soldiers would return to their homes, their families and ‘their’ jobs.

Cartoon titled ‘That Promise’ from The Worker 10 February 1916

Women’s pre-war wages were usually about half of what men were paid for doing the same work. This was decided in the 1907 Harvester Case, in which Justice Higgins established the principle of a basic wage that would enable a man to support a wife and three children. Women’s wages were to be a percentage of this amount. In the Rural Workers’ Case in 1912, Justice Higgins refused women the right to equal pay for equal work because they ‘did not have to feed a family’.

He assumed that all ‘breadwinners’ were men and that all females would have a man to support them. World War I showed the reality to be different, with some men enlisting to escape unwelcome family responsibilities. The government responded by ensuring soldiers allocated part of their pay to wives and children at home.

## Women’s Recruitment Role

Australia needed to attract volunteers to serve in an army outside Australia as the law restricted the regular army to service on Australian soil. The government expected women to show their patriotism by putting pressure on men to enlist. It created posters depicting women as potentially helpless and passive victims of unrestricted German aggression, and enlistment as the only means of protecting them. In the conscription campaigns of 1916 and 1917, women launched appeals for both the ‘yes’ and the ‘no’ vote.

## Grief and Worry

Women on the home front were part of a community for whom sad news was an ever present threat. Many had a husband, brother, son or friend serving overseas. In a world without television or the internet, most had no mental image of the places where their loved ones battled, the conditions they endured or the cemeteries where they were buried.

Some women could balance the news of a loved one’s death with the thought that it had been for ‘a noble cause’. At the same time, they had to re-make their lives with the knowledge that someone they cared for would not return.

This was a personal and individual hardship that the nation could not share. As war continued and numbers of casualties on the Western Front multiplied, some women became more cynical and more questioning when faced with government and community expectations that they continue to express patriotic enthusiasm for war.
