# Long Term Causes - The Path to War

Though World War I began in 1914, its causes can be traced back to tensions and suspicions which had developed over a great number of years. The path to war involved nationalism, militarism, imperialism and alliances.

## The Path To War

### Militarism

Militarism is a policy of developing powerful weapons and military forces to be used in defence or to attack other nations if this supports the national interests. In the lead-up to World War I all of the Great Powers of Europe were involved in increasing the strength of their armies and navies. This 'arms race', as it became known, greatly increased tensions between the nations of Europe.

### Alliances

Alliances are economic or military agreements made between two or more nations. In the lead-up to World War I the Great Powers of Europe came to form two very powerful alliances which became extremely hostile towards each other. The Triple Alliance of 1882 saw Germany, Austria and Italy sign an alliance in which all three nations agreed to support each other in time of war. The Triple Entente of 1907 saw France, Russia and Great Britain form a defensive pact aimed solely against the power of the Triple Alliance. The effect of these two alliances was to increase tensions between the Great Powers and to split Europe into two divided camps, each fearing the power of the other.

### Nationalism

Nationalism is a strong loyalty for your own country and the belief that its needs are more important than those of other countries. By the beginning of the twentieth century, European nationalism had become aggressive. Nations turned against each other as they strived to become more powerful and important than the countries around them.Â 

### Imperialism

Imperialism saw the nations of Europe compete with each other to establish large empires. The countries which made up these empires, known as colonies, provided raw materials, land for expansion, markets for manufactured goods, and military and trading bases for the European powers that controlled them. In times of war, colonies were expected to help fight for their colonial powers. This helped make the 1914-18 conflict a 'world' war.

Individually, any of these four long-term factors could have led to war. Together they combined to produce heightened tensions, fears and suspicions between the Great Powers. Because of these factors a 'war climate' developed where people began to believe that war was inevitable and that it was even something to be desired.

### Who Were the Great Powers?

In the years leading up to World War I, the Great Powers of Europe were Britain, France, Russia, Germany, Austria, Italy and the Turkish Ottoman Empire.
