# Gallipoli Battles and Outcome

## August 1915: Lone Pine and the Nek

### Lone Pine

In August, the British, under regional commander Sir Ian Hamilton, decided to try a new tactic to break the deadlock. Anzac troops were to attack the Turkish strongholds at Lone Pine and the Nek in the hope of distracting attention from Allied troops landing at Suvla Bay and Allied attacks at Sari Bair. The aim was for them to gain control of Sari Bair and link the Anzac front with Suvla Bay.

At Lone Pine, the Australians surprised the Turks by emerging from underground tunnels that extended to about half-way between their own lines and the Turkish lines. However, they became easy targets for Turkish gunfire until they found a way into the Turkish trenches, which were covered with logs and earth. The Anzacs succeeded in taking Lone Pine but at a huge cost to both sides. Over four days of bitter hand-to-hand fighting, from 6 August to 10 August, the Anzacs suffered 2300 casualties and the Turks suffered 6000. Seven Australians gained Victoria Crosses as a result of this action.

### The Nek

The attack at the Nek was even worse. In the early hours of 7 August 1915, hundreds of men from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade went ‘over the top’ of their trenches in four virtually suicidal charges against the Turkish trenches at ‘Baby 700’, only 27 metres away. The attack failed for a number of reasons:

- New Zealand troops were meant to attack at the same time from Chunuk Bair, which leaders believed they could capture the night before. This would mean they would be attacking from the rear of Turkish troops at Baby 700. However, it was 8 August, 24 hours later, before the New Zealanders even got to Chunuk Bair.
- Allied artillery shells from a preliminary bombardment overshot their targets.
- A seven-minute gap between the end of the artillery bombardment and the beginning of the infantry attack meant that the Turks had both warning of what was to come and enough time to prepare for it.

With the New Zealanders unable to attack from behind Turkish lines, there was no reason to begin what would become a frontal attack on heavily defended Turkish positions. Not having received any counter-instructions, the first and second waves of the Light Horse went ‘over the top’ and faced relentless machine-gun and rifle fire from the Turkish trenches.

Major Antill, second in charge of the Brigade, was convinced that some Australians had reached the Turkish trenches. He insisted, despite protests from another of the Light Horse commanders, that a third wave go over the top as well. This had better results only because the soldiers knew to hit the ground as quickly as possible. Colonel Hughes, commander in charge of the 3rd Light Horse, then cancelled the attack. This was too late for the fourth wave, who had already left their trenches. In a 45 minute period, there were 372 casualties among the Light Horse, of whom 234 died.

|The most tragic feint attack, at once the most gallant and the most hopeless, was made by the 8th and 10th Light Horse Regiments against the Turkish trenches at The Nek. The Nek was a ridge 50 yards wide at the Anzac line, narrowing to about 30 at the Turkish front. The opposing trenches on it were about 20 yards apart, and at least five Turkish machine guns covered the intervening ground. Four lines of the light horse, each of about 150 men, were to seize the enemy front line and the maze of trenches and saps behind it, on Baby 700. They would be preceded by a naval and artillery bombardment, and were to attack at two minute intervals. The light horsemen were eager and confident, for this was their first great battle, and they expected to break from the interminable trenches into the open.<br><br>  <br><br>Sick men hid or escaped from their doctors to be in the charge . . .<br><br>  <br><br>At four in the afternoon of 6 August the artillery began a gentle bombardment. It intensified early on the 7th, but at four twenty three a.m., seven minutes before time, it ceased . . . In the enemy trenches soldiers cautiously emerged from shelter, lined their front two deep, fired short bursts to clear their machine guns, levelled their rifles, and waited. At four thirty precisely the first line of the 8th Light Horse leapt from their trenches. As their helmets appeared above the parapet, an awful fire broke upon them.<br><br>  <br><br>Many were shot, but a line started forward. It crumpled and vanished within five yards . . . The second line saw the fate of their friends.<br><br>  <br><br>Over their heads the Turk fire thundered undiminished, drowning out any verbal order . . . Beside them lay dead and wounded of the first line, hit before they cleared the trench. But they waited two minutes as ordered, then sprang forward. They were shot down. The 10th Light Horse filed into the vacant places in the trench.<br><br>  <br><br>They could hardly have doubted their fate . . . and they determined to die bravely, by running swiftly at the enemy. ‘Boys, you have ten minutes to live,’ their commanding officer told them, ‘and I am going to lead you.’ Men shook hands with their mates, took position, and when the order came, charged into the open. The bullets . . . tumbled them into the dust beside their comrades.<br><br>  <br><br>Moves were made to halt the fourth line, but too late, and these men, too, climbed out to be killed. It was now a little after five fifteen a.m. Two hundred and thirty-four dead light horsemen lay in an area little larger than a tennis court . . . One hundred and thirty-eight others were wounded . . . ‘It was heroic,’ wrote one who watched them, ‘it was marvellous . . . yet it was murder.’<br><br>Bill Gammage, The Broken Years, ANU, Canberra, 1974, pp. 73–5.|

## The Outcome

By late August 1915, some British military strategists were beginning to think that they had little chance of defeating Turkish troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula. At the same time, campaign leader Sir Ian Hamilton’s largely optimistic reports failed to indicate just how bad the situation was. This changed when Australian journalist Keith Murdoch arrived in London from Gallipoli in mid September.

Murdoch smuggled out a letter that English journalist Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett had written to inform the British Prime Minister, H.H. Asquith, of his concerns about the campaign and especially about Hamilton’s performance. When military officials confiscated Ashmead-Bartlett’s letter, Murdoch recorded his own version of it. Asquith and his ministers read this account, accepted it unquestioningly and in mid October dismissed Hamilton. The new commander, General Sir Charles Munro, advised evacuation rather than continue with what he predicted would be a 30–40 per cent casualty rate.

Allied troops began withdrawing from Anzac Cove and Suvla Bay in early December 1915. They devised a number of tricks to try to camouflage their withdrawal:

- Australian troops kept silent for long periods of time and then, when the Turks appeared to find out what was happening, they opened fire.
- They also organised a method whereby water dripped into a pan attached to a trigger would make a rifle fire itself.

By 19 December, the evacuation was complete, with only two casualties. By this time, there were 26 000 casualties among the Anzac troops, including about 10 000 deaths.
