# The Treaty of Versailles

By the time the war ended in 1918, millions were dead, including 60000 Australians.

Germany was blamed for causing the war, and its traditional enemy, France, ensured that the peace settlement punished the Germans and made the country pay heavily for the cost of the war. The map of Europe was redrawn after World War I without the former empires of Russia, Austria-Hungary and Turkey. New countries such as Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia were created. The first communist state, the USSR, emerged from the collapse of the Russian monarchy. The end of World War I saw an international desire to create an organisation that would ensure world peace. Led by America in its new role as a world power, the League of Nations was formed.

At the end of World War I, leaders of 32 Countries met at the Paris Peace Conference, which began on 12th January 1919, to discuss the Treaties to be made with each of the defeated powers. Negotiations were dominated by Britain (represented by prime minister David Lloyd George), France (represented by prime minister Georges Clemenceau), Italy (represented by prime minister Vittorio Orlando), Japan (represented by a former prime minister, Saionji Kinmochi) and the United States (represented by president Woodrow Wilson). Australia was represented by its prime minister, William (Billy) Hughes.

Division existed among these representatives on how Harshly the defeated countries should be treated. The United States wanted a fair and Just settlement, for example, whereas France (and Australia) wanted Germany to be severely Punished.

The French were to have their way. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28  June 1919, Germany was Reduced in size, lost its overseas colonies, could not have an Airforce or tanks, forbidden to unite with Austria, and had to pay reparations to the Allies for the cost of the War.

## Conditions for the Treaty of Versailles

Under the Treaty of Versailles, Germany had to:

- accept a vote to be held in northern Schleswig to settle whether the territory was part of Germany or not
- agree that Germany and Austria were never to be unified
- allow Danzig, which had been an important German port, to become a free city (the surrounding land became part of Poland)
- allow the Saarland (a resource-rich area) to come under French control
- be demilitarised and allow the Rhineland to be occupied by non-German armies for 15 years
- give Eupen-Malmedy to Belgium, Memel to Lithuania, and the Hultschin district to Czechoslovakia
- limit its army to 100 000 men and agree that Germany was not to have conscription, heavy artillery, poison gas, tanks, aircraft or airships, that its navy could not have vessels of more than 100,000 tonnes and that no submarines were allowed.
- pay war reparations of £6600 million (this is equivalent to approximately $2.6 trillion today, or more than two-and-a-half times the value of the entire Australian economy- its gross domestic product-in 2011)
- return the border region of Alsace-Lorraine to France
- surrender all of its colonies
- surrender Poznania, parts of East Prussia and Upper Silesia (on Germany's eastern border) to Poland
- take responsibility for starting the war (covered by the 'war guilt' clause)
