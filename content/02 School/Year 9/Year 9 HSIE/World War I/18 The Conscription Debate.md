# The Conscription Debate

Australia’s involvement in World War I

## Conscription

Conscription meant forcing able bodied men of military age to fight in the war. This means that the government could randomly select men of the appropriate age and make them go to war. If the men refused to go, they would be breaking the law.

The Conscription Debate was very divisive. This was especially because the war was being fought overseas and Australia was not directly threatened. Was it acceptable to force people to fight for wars in other countries?

# Conscription in Australia

As the news came from Gallipoli that more troops were needed on the Front, the call for recruits was sent out across the Empire.

Britain passed laws to introduce conscription in January 1916. Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes wanted to follow suit and held the first referendum to poll the Australian population in October 1916. The voting was close and a NO vote was passed. A massive recruitment drive was launched across the Empire; however, supply could not meet demand as huge losses were experienced in the trenches and on the battlefields of Somme and Ypres. 

A second referendum was held in December 1917 and this time, a resounding NO came from the Australian public. Many attributed this change in public opinion to the climbing death toll on the battlefields.

As a result of two failed referendums, Conscription was not introduced in Australia during the Great War.

| - A vote for Conscription was a ‘blood vote’.<br><br>- Australia enjoyed Britain’s protection and we should pay for it.<br><br>- Let’s finish the job the Gallipoli Diggers started.<br><br>- Men in the trenches need to be supported.<br><br>- Patriotism towards Britain.<br><br>- Prime Minister Hughes had promised to help Britain (16,500 men a month). By 1917, there were only 4,500 recruits per month. | - ‘No’ voters are supporting Germany (They are traitors to Britain).<br><br>- Conscription was a denial of an individual’s freedom.<br><br>- Inequality of sacrifice—the working class suffered most.<br><br>- Men should not be sent to war against their will.<br><br>- The Irish, led by Archbishop Mannix, were particularly against conscription. They had little loyalty to England.<br><br>- Trade unionists believed it was a “bosses’ war.” Extreme unionists supported strikes to end the war, such as the IWW (Industrial Workers of the World), known as the “Wobblies.”<br><br>- War is futile (pointless)—this was the stance of moral or ‘conscientious objectors. |

## Propaganda Techniques

Propaganda means deliberately presenting a one sided story, usually through news items, books or posters.

Both sides of the conscription debate exaggerated their case by playing on peoples’ emotions such as:  Guilt, Duty, Hatred, Loyalty, Patriotism and particularly, Love of family.
