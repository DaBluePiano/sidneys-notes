# Movement of Peoples

## The Main Causes of Migration from 1750 to 1901

The period from 1750 to 1901 saw an unprecedented increase in the number of people moving around the world – a process known as ==migration==. Some people moved within their ==own countries== (e.g. from rural areas to urban areas) while others moved ==between countries== (e.g. from England to new colonies in North America and Australia).

==There were many reasons why people moved. Historians try to understand the different reasons for migration by organising them into four main categories:==

- ==**economic migration** – moving in search of work. During the Industrial Revolution, mass migration took place as people moved from the countryside to growing towns and cities across England searching for work in factories and mines there. Later, once gold had been discovered in British colonies in Australia, thousands migrated in search of wealth.==
- ==**social migration** – moving for a better quality of life or to be closer to family and friends. With steady work came an improved standard of living. Many people believed that industrial cities offered opportunities for a better life. Others believed that a fresh start in a far-off land offered these opportunities.==
- ==**political migration** – moving to escape political persecution or war. A large number of people who moved from England to other parts of the world during the 18th and 19th centuries were political prisoners or radical thinkers who had criticised the monarch of England or challenged the authority of the government. These people were transported by force or fled persecution of their own accord.==
- ==**environmental migration** – moving to escape natural disasters such as flooding and famine. In Ireland between 1845 and 1852, a period known as the Great Famine (or Irish Potato Famine) led to more than one million Irish men, women and children leaving their homeland in search of a safer environment in which to rebuild their lives.==

As well as grouping migrants, historians also consider a range of other factors that influence people’s decisions. ==These are known as push factors and pull factors.==== ==Push factors are negative things that tend to push people away from certain places, whereas pull factors are positive things that pull people towards a certain place.== Some examples of push factors include poverty, famine, crop failure, lack of employment, overcrowding, natural disasters, war, and political or religious oppression. Some examples of pull factors include better job opportunities, more space and greater religious and political freedoms.

### Defining Migration and Understanding Different Types of Migrants

Before learning about the events of the period, it is important to define some key terms and groups of people. These terms are used frequently throughout this chapter, so refer back to this list whenever you need to. They include:

- ==**emigration**: the departure of people from their homeland (country of birth) to settle permanently in a new country==
- ==**immigration**: the arrival of people into a new country to settle permanently==
- ==**migration**: the movement of people within a country or from one country to another==
- ==**convict**: a person found guilty or a crime and sentenced to punishment by a court; convicts in Britain during the 18th century were often transported to serve a sentence in British colonies such as Australia==
- ==**slave**: a person who is considered to be the property of another person and has very few (if any) rights; during the 18th century, many Africans were enslaved by Europeans and taken by force to the Americas==
- ==**free settler**: a person who pays their way and chooses to settle in a new country==
- ==**assisted migrant**: a person who receives assistance from a government or organisation to move to another country.==

When learning about the movement of peoples during this period, we need to consider the perspectives of the various people involved. For example, the perspectives and experiences of slaves and convicts will be very different to the perspectives and experiences of free settlers. The perspectives of these different people will have influenced how they viewed or reacted to specific events at the time. They will also have influenced the ways in which people recorded and wrote about their experiences. It is always important to consider the impact that a particular perspective will have on a source.

### Push Factors

Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in 1750, many factors have pushed people towards starting a new life elsewhere. A range of these factors is discussed below.

#### The Agricultural Revolution

Until the early 18th century, most people in Europe lived in rural areas and worked in agriculture. Land use had changed little since the Middle Ages, and families often worked the same land for generations. Most peasants worked enough to provide food to feed their families. Their lives were simple and there was a certainty about their roles as members of village communities.

All of this changed with the development of new farming techniques and agricultural machines during the 18th century. The Agricultural Revolution began in Britain but quickly spread to Western Europe. ==New methods of crop rotation and animal breeding== – as well as the invention of machines for ploughing, sowing seed and harvesting – improved crop yields and quality of meat (see Source 3).

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdm0_AsC48BwiS5OHiDeGfRDO8IsP1ALejjFQgtSbHXp-pGRh5wx1IrDfkDCtthFR2jF3GizeaHnGHwIlT3koYc13YoI2AsGau14Ldb9WVavPNJ1H5f7IXWT6pa77WjyG7IQnm7rQ?key=AP8ZcnWs1AdShicc0Arsq4bu)

Source 3 The seed drill invented by Jethro Tull made the sowing of crops easier and involved far less waste of seed. It also required fewer labourers.

These new approaches to farming were beneficial for the landowners, but ==forced many peasants off the lands that their ancestors had farmed==. Wealthy landowners enclosed fields for planting and grazing. They still required peasants to look after the crops and animals, but the new machines meant fewer labourers were needed. This was the first major example of technology claiming jobs.

The Agricultural Revolution resulted in a wave of migration from the country to newly emerging towns and cities. Many who had lost their livelihoods in villages, especially the young and single, flocked to the towns and cities looking for work. This migration coincided with the Industrial Revolution.

#### The Industrial Revolution

==At the same time as new methods and machines were modernising agriculture, new approaches to manufacturing and food processing were emerging.== The steam engine paved the way for the development of machines such as the locomotive, spinning and weaving machines, pumps to assist mining, and smelters to process the ores.

A vast unskilled or semi-skilled labour force was required to support this new industrial economy. ==Working conditions were terrible and there were also no laws banning child labour.== As a result, children as young as six were put to work in the mines and factories (see Source 4). Their size made them valuable to employers because they could fit into small spaces and climb under machines. ==They often worked in great danger for very little money.==

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdoKrMqpk_36AxXceXln9d1GQl8Aw1Kzf2CD4iViy5awRRRpxkI61bHWecwGaYfxSXP7MyKNfqGu5wPsOKKJnAUyZ9Fs7ghUsx-Ie0CRM6t_Hces_YzmRUsJhqMHYZIMiGfREKBNg?key=AP8ZcnWs1AdShicc0Arsq4bu)

Source 4 Children were often forced to work in factories during the Industrial Revolution. This was a push factor for some families to emigrate.

The great migration of people into towns and cities across England provided the labour force for the new factories. English cities such as Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham grew rapidly. ==This resulted in overcrowding and unhealthy living conditions.== For many of the poor in these industrial cities, as well as the displaced in rural areas, migrating to new countries in search of a better life provided a way out. ==A great increase in crime==, plus overcrowded jails, contributed to another of the major push factors behind emigration from Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries – the transportation of convicts to penal colonies in North America and Australia.

#### Population Growth

During the 18th century, ==improvements in food production and new discoveries in medicine and hygiene led to a significant increase in population==. The birth rate was rising, fewer children were dying and adults, on average, were living longer. Between 1750 and 1800, the population of Britain grew from 6.5 million to 9 million. ==This population growth created great pressures==, especially at a time when new technology on farms and in factories was reducing the number of available jobs. Emigration provided a kind of safety valve in reducing pressure on jobs, housing and resources.

#### Natural Disasters: the Irish Potato Famine

==Over the centuries, natural disasters have also been push factors motivating groups of people to leave their homelands in order to survive.== One such natural disaster took place in Ireland in the middle of the 19th century. It resulted in one of the greatest movements of people from a single, country, and occurred as a result of the failure of the potato crop in Ireland.

At the time of the famine, most Irish farmers rented the farming lands on which they lived and worked from wealthy English lords. The majority of crops and animals that the Irish farmers produced on these lands were paid as rent, leaving most peasant families to rely heavily on the potato crop in order to survive. In the 1840s, the potato crop failed several years in a row because of poor soil and a disease called potato blight that made the potatoes inedible. Most landowners refused to waive the rents, which would have enabled the Irish farmers to survive this tragedy.

The result was starvation in Ireland while tonnes of edible crops (paid in rent) were shipped to England. Those who were evicted from their cottages for non-payment of rent often finished up in workhouses where they received only the most basic accommodation and food. Disease was widespread in most workhouses, and the already starving and weakened peasants had little resistance. The most disastrous years of famine were from 1847 to 1849. The famine, which became known as the Great Famine, caused between 1 and 1.5 million deaths and resulted in up to two million people leaving Ireland in search of a better life.

Over the ten years of the Great Famine, the population of Ireland decreased by one-third. A small percentage of those who left Ireland travelled to Australia and New Zealand, but most went to North America because the journey was shorter and cheaper. However, it is estimated that up to one in five emigrants died making the voyage. As a result, the ships they travelled on became known as ‘coffin ships’. Poor sanitation, overcrowding, lack of food and disease meant that many passengers, already weakened by starvation, were not able to survive the journey.

#### Discrimination and Persecution

Over the centuries, many waves of emigrants have also left their homelands to ==escape religious or political persecution==. Certain American colonies, for example, were established by Puritans (a group of English Protestants who believed in strict religious discipline) escaping religious persecution in Britain.

Jewish people had suffered discrimination in Europe for centuries and emigrated to escape persecution. They often became scapegoats when times were tough, because some Jews appeared to be more wealthy and successful than other groups in society. However, this perception was often untrue. Many Jewish people, especially in Eastern Europe, were not allowed to own land and were among the poorest peasants. During the 19th century there were organised attacks on Jews (see Source 5). This led to many Jews fleeing to countries like the USA.

#### Forced Migration

==Not all people who left their homelands during this period of history did so willingly. In fact, the largest number of migrants at this time were forced to move. These groups included slaves and convicts.==

From the early 17th century, hundreds of thousands of African people were captured and transported across the Atlantic to America as slaves (see Source 6). This meant they were taken prisoner and then sold as goods. The purpose of this scheme was to provide a free labour force in the North American colonies.

A smaller scheme also involved the capture of people from islands across the Pacific and the transfer of these people to Queensland from the 1860s. These people, who became known as South Sea Islanders, were used as cheap labour on Queensland sugar cane and pineapple plantations (see Source 7).

In addition to the forced migration of slaves, between 1788 and 1868 over 165 000 convicted British criminals – many guilty of only minor crimes – were transported across the world to the Australian colonies. Although these people were forced migrants, great opportunities were offered to those convicts who worked hard and did not reoffend. After their release, many ex-convicts in Australia reflected that transportation had eventually provided a better way of life than they could ever have hoped for in Britain. Only a small percentage of convicts returned to Britain when they had completed their sentences.

### Pull Factors

Some pull factors that encouraged people to migrate during this period included things like the ==promise of a better life, better employment opportunities, more space, more fertile soil, greater personal freedom and the opportunity to shape the future of an undeveloped land.==

Between 1750 and 1901, millions of people were pulled towards particular destinations as a result of a range of these factors. North America and Australia offered stability, democracy and a future. The discovery of gold in both regions during this period also led to a dramatic increase in the population.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, North America, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa offered abundant land that many Europeans saw as theirs for the taking. In some cases, free grants of land were made to attract new settlers. Even when land was not free, prices were usually low and it was relatively easy for newcomers to set up small farms and build new lives. This pull factor, along with a range of other factors, is discussed below in relation to North America and the Australian colonies.

#### North America

From 1775 to 1783, thirteen colonies in North America fought a War of Independence to break free from British control. After winning their independence, a period of growth and expansion began and the country we now think of as the United States of America began to take shape. As people moved west across the country, new settlements and trade routes developed, creating employment and opportunities to own land.

By the late 19th century, other British colonies and settlements across Canada were also starting to expand. Like the USA, Canada had large areas of land available. To encourage development, land was given free to settlers along the route of the Canadian Pacific Railway – a railway line built during the 1880s connecting the east coast of Canada with the west coast.

In 1848, gold was discovered in California. This led to a gold rush that brought around 300 000 people to California over the next five years, transforming the area. This was followed by a Colorado gold rush that led to the development of the area inland from California. Over time, the goal of developing the USA as a land of opportunity that stretched from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west was achieved.

==The idea of ‘America’ as a prosperous democracy was a powerful pull factor for the many Europeans who had seen their lives worsen as a result of the Industrial Revolution.==

#### Idaho Springs

In 1859, ==gold was discovered== in Idaho Springs in Colorado, USA. This began the Colorado gold rush that followed the one in California. Like many areas, Idaho Springs was transformed by the sudden influx of goldminers and the support industries necessary to provide them with goods and services such as tools, meals and accommodation.

It is important to see how both the California and Colorado gold rushes transformed different areas, but it is also just as important to look how these areas stayed the same over time. Sources 1 and 2 are photographs taken over 100 years apart. As a historian, it is important that you train yourself to look for obvious changes, but also take the time to explore continuities. Continuities are often more difficult to recognise, but they are also important in historical study. For example, although the methods of transportation in Idaho Springs have changed, the basic layout of the town and a number of its buildings remain unchanged.

Source 2 The same street in Idaho Springs in 2011

#### Australia

When the First Fleet arrived in Australia to establish a British colony in 1788, they were carrying around 750 convicts, soldiers and government officials with them. This was the first British population of Australia. Life was difficult in such a different climate, but gradually the first colony expanded. By the 19th century there were also colonies in Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia.

As exploration opened the continent to settlement, the need for workers increased. Convicts were gradually replaced by free settlers and a new class of assisted migrants (people who were given financial assistance from the government to encourage them to move to Australia).

If workers in Britain possessed a particular skill, employers in Australia could apply for financial assistance to bring them over to settle and work here. Magazines often featured cartoons comparing life in England with life in the colonies (see Source 3). This kind of assisted migration continued throughout the 20th century and was an important way of boosting the number of immigrants arriving in Australia.

==The discovery of gold helped transform Australia.== Gold was first discovered in New South Wales in 1851. Between 1850 and 1860 the population of Australia more than doubled. In addition to the thousands who arrived in search of wealth on the goldfields (see Source 4) were groups of political refugees (known as Chartists), activists and religious orders. These groups believed there was greater opportunity to think and speak freely, express differing political views and practise one’s chosen religion in Australia.

## Agricultural Revolution - Enclosure

==In English History, enclosure was the process which ended the traditional right of all people to use common land to grow crops or raise livestock.==

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeleYykvox-qEZQVNVlDYhjGwMDvIHYLhm23SzhKkxWGR4JAQeaaHjrIvopTOhy8T6lkwpcn9-7cPW24WzDPjufAna_vgdx9KzQGWKTqy7wY0q0-4iHmMO00_OIvQzrkADaJf5l7A?key=Pix1EM3zuyyKeg7imBI8Ot7z)

==Traditionally large sections of land were common land, which allowed people to grow enough (on that land) to survive on and raise their families, without a paid job.== ==This is known as subsistence farming.==

==The process of enclosure restricted use of land to the owner/s, barring all others from using it.== This process started around the 1500s and saw the countryside divided up into a patchwork of fields and paddocks, separated by fences made of stone or hedges.

By the 1800s, most common land in England had been put into private hands. ==In many cases, the rich used their power to force poor families off the land they inhabited legally for generations, leaving them homeless.==

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeR-xLuBVYAYO6bhTFoJ59d4ato22u7RqabpqxN8iHAaOO3mv81qkaAWszQkBr5gQetgePOEy-rLfGbwS6fSQk-thM26kcMG3D1gTI38ipYYcEoXvgWg3pYDaWJPeOQt4XKJA5C?key=Pix1EM3zuyyKeg7imBI8Ot7z)

### Contestability

==One perspective on the process of enclosure is that enclosure was sometimes accompanied by force, resistance, and bloodshed, and remains among the most controversial areas of agricultural and economic history in England.== Marxist and neo-Marxist historians argue that rich landowners used their control of state processes to appropriate public land for their private benefit. This created a landless working class that provided the labour required in the new industries developing in the north of England.

For example, one Marxist view was: "In agriculture the years between 1760 and 1820 are the years of wholesale enclosure in which, in village after village, common rights are lost. Enclosure (when all the sophistications are allowed for) was a plain enough case of class robbery".

Alternately, W. A. Armstrong argued that this is perhaps an oversimplification, that the better-off members of the European peasantry encouraged and participated actively in enclosure, seeking to end the perpetual poverty of subsistence farming. He stated, "we should be careful not to ascribe to [enclosure] developments that were the consequence of a much broader and more complex process of historical change. The impact of the eighteenth and nineteenth century enclosure has been grossly exaggerated....”

### People Move to New Industrial Cities

==The Industrial Revolution brought rapid urbanization, or the movement of people to cities.== ==Changes in farming, soaring population growth, and an ever-increasing demand for workers led masses of people to migrate from farms to cities.== Almost overnight, small towns around coal or iron mines mushroomed into cities.

Other cities grew up around the factories that entrepreneurs built in once-quiet market towns. The British market town of Manchester numbered 17,000 people in the 1750s. Within a few years, it exploded into a centre of the textile industry. Its population soared to 40,000 by 1780 and 70,000 by 1801. Visitors described the “cloud of coal vapour” that polluted the air, the pounding noise of steam engines, and the filthy stench of its river. 

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcLX3ULBNjXFzkbCT01q1pOx7CuZQ3TuZ49Tpxmky5OnK7S1AfeP1uAciWJ1UM2vMTLl5j3F5RpO0fdfEofKtrL-mttAucd-CuaZOpY19lDs-n7i-2fsSgl8U5iC5Yhz3ohdcAQ?key=Pix1EM3zuyyKeg7imBI8Ot7z)

As enclosure locked people off their land, they were forced to move to the big industrial cities looking for work

## Why Did the Industrial Revolution Begin in Great Britain

==The Industrial Revolution marked a period of development in the latter half of the 18th century that transformed largely rural,== agrarian societies in Europe and America into ==industrialised, urban ones.== Goods that had once been painstakingly crafted by hand started to be produced in mass quantities by machines in factories, thanks to the introduction of new machines and techniques in textiles, iron making and other industries.

Fuelled by the game-changing use of steam power, ==the Industrial Revolution began in Britain and spread to the rest of the world, including the United States, by the 1830s and ‘40s.== Modern historians often refer to this period as the First Industrial Revolution, to set it apart from a second period of industrialisation that took place from the late 19th to early 20th centuries and saw rapid advances in the steel, electric and automobile industries.

### England: Birthplace of the Industrial Revolution

==Thanks in part to its damp climate, ideal for raising sheep, Britain had a long history of producing textiles like wool, linen and cotton.== But prior to the Industrial Revolution, the British textile business was a true “cottage industry,” with the work performed in small workshops or even homes by individual spinners, weavers and dyers.

Starting in the mid-18th century, innovations like the flying shuttle, the spinning jenny, the water frame and the power loom made weaving cloth and spinning yarn and thread much easier. Producing cloth became faster and required less time and far less human labor.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeX0uu7iEQTaDTFX2iqsX-8LgGN4403KDBiWik3ZfxIqZZ0QjPOdUzMowHG0Un4cVlfBDKfLVU-Al18NDtiUKvbh2cT6ngG5y-H7FGYvZT09L8Yr0UhoKdICLV4UBbv33vO7Vlu7w?key=hoHmJWnELFnsvAodMA5pcKvf)

More efficient, mechanised production meant Britain’s new textile factories could meet the growing demand for cloth both at home and abroad, where the nation’s many overseas colonies provided a captive market for its goods. In addition to textiles, the British iron industry also adopted new innovations. Chief among the new techniques was the smelting of iron ore with coal (a material made by heating coal) instead of the traditional charcoal. This method was both cheaper and produced higher-quality material, enabling Britain’s iron and steel production to expand in response to demand created by the Napoleonic Wars (1803-15) and the later growth of the railway industry.

### Impact of Steam Power

==An icon of the Industrial Revolution broke onto the scene in the early 1700s, when Thomas Newcomen designed the prototype for the first modern steam engine.== Called the “atmospheric steam engine,” Newcomen’s invention was originally applied to power the machines used to pump water out of mine shafts.

![|315x407](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcLcGTtF5Zws_v_kTMRHf3bffX45Uy7ZrWpuVTE-K171KhpzRkQkpkD7p03M16o0B-wGdppv9ta2n3Sa0kBwYamdILF8l_SiZ5bTpIPBZgtctV-ur0J4Gwap_EukFg3_zsAUXkFBg?key=hoHmJWnELFnsvAodMA5pcKvf)

In the 1760s, Scottish engineer James Watt began tinkering with one of Newcomen’s models, adding a separate water condenser that made it far more efficient. Watt later collaborated with Matthew Boulton to invent a steam engine with a rotary motion, a key innovation that would allow steam power to spread across British industries, including flour, paper, and cotton mills, iron works, distilleries, waterworks and canals.

Just as steam engines needed coal, steam power allowed miners to go deeper and extract more of this relatively cheap energy source. The demand for coal skyrocketed throughout the Industrial Revolution and beyond, as it would be needed to run not only the factories used to produce manufactured goods, but also the railroads and steamships used for transporting them.

### Transportation During the Industrial Revolution

#### Evolution of Railways

Britain’s road network, which had been relatively primitive prior to industrialisation, soon saw substantial improvements, and more than 2,000 miles of canals were in use across Britain by 1815. In the early 1800s, Richard Trevithick debuted a steam-powered locomotive, and in 1830 similar locomotives started transporting freight (and passengers) between the industrial hubs of Manchester and Liverpool. By that time, steam-powered boats and ships were already in wide use, carrying goods along Britain’s rivers and canals as well as across the Atlantic.

### Communication and Banking in the Industrial Revolution

The latter part of the Industrial Revolution also saw key ==advances in communication methods==, as people increasingly saw the need to communicate efficiently over long distances. In 1837, British inventors William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone patented the ==first commercial telegraphy system==, even as Samuel Morse and other inventors worked on their own versions in the United States. Cooke and Wheatstone’s system would be used for railroad signalling, as the speed of the new trains had created a need for more sophisticated means of communication.

Banks and industrial financiers rose to new prominence during the period, as well as a factory system dependent on owners and managers. A stock exchange was established in London in the 1770s; the New York Stock Exchange was founded in the early 1790s.

In 1776, Scottish social philosopher Adam Smith (1723-1790) promoted an economic system based on free enterprise, the private ownership of means of production, and lack of government interference.

### Working Conditions

Though many people in Britain had begun moving to the cities from rural areas before the Industrial Revolution, this process accelerated dramatically with industrialisation, as the rise of large factories turned smaller towns into major cities over the span of decades. This rapid urbanisation brought significant challenges, as ==overcrowded cities suffered from pollution, inadequate sanitation and a lack of clean drinking water.==

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXceoiAksWQUllVNZGAiugwzS3WK1nrob2Uq6rc45mYXuKu80earHB-9TVoYZp3WK7dlNqNJ3CElTOLkGdLewi4SwXogCsQHe5VqO3cArMEcRSsiY8DANuooB7P743Wij7u7bMrC3A?key=hoHmJWnELFnsvAodMA5pcKvf)

Meanwhile, even as industrialisation increased economic output overall and improved the standard of living for the middle and upper classes, ==poor and working class people continued to struggle.== The mechanisation of labour created by technological innovation had made ==working in factories increasingly tedious== (and sometimes dangerous), and many workers were forced to work long hours for pitifully low wages. Such dramatic changes fuelled opposition to industrialisation, including the “Luddites,” known for their violent resistance to changes in Britain’s textile industry.

In the decades to come, outrage over substandard working and living conditions would fuel the formation of labor unions, as well as the passage of new child labor laws and public health regulations in both Britain and the United States, all aimed at improving life for working class and poor citizens who had been negatively impacted by industrialisation.

### Why Did the Industrial Revolution Start in Great Britain in the 1750s?

==Many factors played a part in the development of the industrial revolution in Great Britain.== The seeds were sown, quite literally, thanks to the agricultural revolution that enabled the production of food surplus and population growth.

Almost simultaneously, any excess in labour was attracted to larger population centres in search of work and fortune. Institutions like the banks of the time could provide capital (money) to brave entrepreneurs to build new technologies and companies that might not otherwise be able to afford to. Importantly, the rule of property rights also promoted investment and risk-taking. Large structures like factories could now be built on credit. 

The granting of patents (the legal right to own the design of a machine) was now turned into a formalised and legally binding system. This further created confidence for investors and inventors to take a gamble.

Britain also happened to have a wealth of coal, iron, and other resources in a relatively small country, that would help kick start the revolution and feed it. It's small, but growing Colonial Empire also provided a ready-made market for surplus goods, providing further impetus to entrepreneurs and new industrialists.

Initial developments occurred in the cotton industry with the development of the spinning jenny, flying shuttle and power loom, and very soon, other industries would benefit from industrialisation.

## The Industrial Revolution Nature and Significance

==The Industrial Revolution is the name given to the great changes that began in Britain in the eighteenth century.== These changes altered the way in which goods were made, and the way that people lived. The task of making goods was taken out of small homes and villages and placed into large new centres of manufacturing where people, materials and technology were gathered.

Historians regard industrialisation as the biggest change in human history since the coming of the wheel, or the development of agriculture. ==Like these earlier revolutionary changes, the Industrial Revolution did not begin suddenly, but occurred over a long period of time.==

### Australian Manufacturing for the Masses

The technology of the industrial revolution was quickly adopted in Britain's most remote colony, New South Wales. Australia's first steam-powered flour mill commenced operation in 1813 at Darling Harbour. Barker's Mill ground wheat so efficiently that by 1826 their production levels required the construction of a five-storey high grain store and a large wharf to enable distribution of processed goods.

Transport and communication links became a priority as Australia's agricultural industry developed. By 1830 steamships were regularly in use in New South Wales, followed by the construction of railway lines in the 1850s. As each of the Australian colonies embraced the new technology of overland telegraphs and developed railway systems, more Australian agricultural products and mass-produced goods were transported to the seaports and the expanding overseas markets.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfWpddVyN_e6-vJTZ45mmc547azDRaTNVgrDsu0mBpP43zNTfzDQIrGqUDWl4DNtXZas1oFkhmhCwASZ26lr3qMmgUpjLcSHp7MkJ1Y3QAWA956rA6wOKJVLh4V4140INHrl7p5Bw?key=WQtKy9lGoK_MZ2XUmEUh9PCB)

==The 1851 discovery of gold was one of the most important events in Australia's history.== Technology to sink shafts, transport quartz and extract gold was urgently required. The need for mechanised transport increased and new engineering works were established. ==Australia's economy grew rapidly, affecting every aspect of Australian life.== Factories were built to supply a wealthier and larger population with a vastly expanded range of locally produced goods and services.

The Australian economy boomed during the 1880s. Mining dredges for the goldfields, lifts for city buildings, pumps for water sewerage systems and bricks for thousands of new houses were mass-produced in Australia's factories. The power of technology and industry combined with population growth to transform a penal colony into a thriving new nation.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdsJd0ukrR-iR_VHdVB4ls_cTvhfUemGSqx8N5iwy59lQY-tgYFq9zd2Ucv195qPqZEL5HPOs_uqz8IRg0SWqHrTiip2enE5SFYXnnj-UIyoJvOx4BfrnbkidDT7_sWiVfc30Pz?key=WQtKy9lGoK_MZ2XUmEUh9PCB)

### From Revolution to Reform - Significance of the Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution eventually changed the way that people lived all over the world.

- ==**Structure and organisation of society**: peasants from rural villages became workers living in the slums of industrial towns. The workers were known as the proletariat and the factory owners and managers were known as the bourgeoisie.==
- ==**World population**: increased food production, gradual improvements to living conditions and medical advances led to the growth of the European population from 187 million in 1800 to over 400 million in 1900.==
- ==**Role of governments**: The British Factory Act of 1883 and a range of other laws regulated the employment of children and generally improved working conditions in mines and factories.==
- ==**Contact between regions and countries**: world trade and finance links stimulated economic growth.==
- ==**New political ideas**: the educated middle classes demanded greater representation in government, along with political and personal rights.==
- ==**Technology for warfare**: industrial power and military strength became more closely linked as much larger quantities of armaments were produced.==

## Industrial Revolution Changing Ways of Life

==The rapid growth of factories between 1800 and 1850 affected everybody's lives.== Life improved for mechanics - those who built and serviced the machines. They were paid well, and set up 'mechanics institutes' with their own libraries and held regular lectures there. They became part of a growing middle class.

However, for ordinary workers who had moved from the countryside or emigrated from Ireland and Scotland, working and living conditions were poor. Houses were crowded together, with little natural light and no sanitation. To keep the machines running in the factories, people had to work up to twelve-hour shifts. There was little protection from contact with moving machine parts and no compensation for injured workers.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcVs4dwQYTVU363R3w8sn7IzuLxdlVyHWij6BL57RKIC_os9QFGZhjm3mjesaE4Wv6RzmpHRwoG24e6pmQoUJhETj62QQ7OSaxafPCyn_RsFOpydvOf8EmKZBo3W1J-3oK5ZwhrDg?key=bEFnfggfj5hGa1JFsaEwqrO4)

Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) was the son of a wealthy German industrialist. Sent to work in his father's cotton mill in Manchester, Engels began to discover the reality of how working people lived, and in 1845 he published a book on the subject entitled Condition of the Working Class in England.

|Source 2 - In his book, Condition of the Working Class in England, Engels quotes from a police report after two boys were arrested for stealing and eating a half-cooked calf's foot.<br><br>When a policeman went to his widowed mother's house to investigate, he found her with six of her children literally huddled together in a little back room, with no furniture but two old rush-bottomed chairs with the seats gone, a small table with two legs broken, a broken cup, and a small dish. On the hearth was scarcely a spark of fire, and in one corner lay as many old rags as would fill a woman's apron, which served the whole family as a bed, For bed clothing they had only their scanty day clothing.|

### Children

Most children had worked before the revolution - either helping on the farm or in spinning and weaving in the home. They had no schooling and no childhood as we have today. However, working in factories was far worse than working in the home. They were working near dangerous machinery and, being under the control of employers rather than their parents, they could easily be exploited. Yet wages were so low for adults that a family could not survive without children working.

Exploitation was particularly bad where their small size could be seen as an advantage, such as drawing wagons in narrow mine shafts, cleaning underneath machinery or being used as chimney sweeps. Masters of chimney sweeps found it cheaper to force little children through the chimney rather than use a brush.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfwPuXUBHf8bTX0s7eB4Z2xDDP86ZRz1FozKdd5fIrWsIqWeB3Ab4TPry4B0pDMUZjkjML6fafj4ErtAkRE9w3NCvcECFuos4ztnp5ZaIPfNPevMG8lYcg9mJma2ISBUo4MWQmvig?key=bEFnfggfj5hGa1JFsaEwqrO4)Pressure to change these conditions came from a variety of groups in society:

- evangelical churchmen who felt it their Christian duty to look after the weaker people in society
- rich landowners who resented the new wealthy industrialists
- industrialists themselves who wanted to stop unscrupulous use of cheap labour by their competitors.

A series of bills that passed between 1830 and 1867 gradually led to some regulation of the industry, although the hours worked and the conditions of work were still harsh by today's standards. Some of the most important of these were:

- The Factory Act of 1833, which set legal limits to the working hours of children and was enforced by the appointment of factory inspectors
- The Mines Act of 1842, which banned the employment of women and under-age children in the mines.
- The Ten Hours Bill of 1847, which limited the time worked by women and children in factories to ten hours a day. Because women and children were essential for the running of the machines, it effectively meant that a man's work day was also limited to ten hours.

A series of bills were passed to improve the conditions of children working as chimney sweeps; but because the business was so profitable, these were not enforced and it was not until 1867 that effective legislation was passed.

Source 5 – A historian describes how chimney sweeps were employed.

The very poorest London parents found they could apprentice a child to a chimney sweep much younger than any other occupation. More than this, no apprentice fee was expected, and the master sweep was even ready to pay a sum to the parents for the service of the child, who was thus literally bought and sold. “It was a common practice”, said David Porter, a remarkable master chimney sweeper, “for parents to carry about their children to the master chimney sweepers and dispose of them to the best bidder, as they cannot put them to any other master at so early an age.” (Dorothy George, from England in Transition, Penguin, 1964, pp.123-4.)**

## Working Conditions in Industrial Revolution

### Working Conditions in Factories

- **Long working hours** - normal shifts were usually 12-14 hours a day, with extra time required during busy periods. Workers were often required to clean their machines during their mealtimes.

![|583x578](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcH2vb_lTi_o9-QY8qpC8e5EGnQ42QAYlMuQhHDGilIsASy-dje8W_mOGNIMLVcUbmlmriH8HvWS-XQFXnv1UlkIDQo55DeVoEK_Y2OZ8DbA7HIeXan4QXaslWE6KvQlg?key=XDkjnEVa8BE1j_fT4Kgu9KtJ)

- **Low wages** - a typical wage for male workers was about 15 shillings (75p) a week, but women and children were paid much less, with women earning seven shillings (35p) and children three shillings (15p). For this reason, employers preferred to employ women and children. Many men were sacked when they reached adulthood; then they had to be supported by their wives and children.
- **Cruel discipline** - there was frequent strapping (hitting with a leather strap). Other punishments included hanging iron weights around children's necks, hanging them from the roof in baskets, nailing children's ears to the table, and dowsing them in water butts to keep them awake.
- **Fierce systems of fines** - these were imposed for talking or whistling, leaving the room without permission, or having a little dirt on a machine. It was claimed that employers altered the time on the clocks to make their workers late so that they could fine them. Some employers demanded that their overseers raise a minimum amount each week from fines.
- **Accidents** - forcing children to crawl into dangerous, unguarded machinery led to many accidents. Up to 40 per cent of accident cases at Manchester Infirmary in 1833 were factory accidents.
- **Health** - cotton thread had to be spun in damp, warm conditions. Going straight out into the cold night air led to many cases of pneumonia. The air was full of dust, which led to chest and lung diseases and loud noise made by machines damaged workers' hearing.
- **Parish apprentices** - orphans from workhouses in southern England were apprenticed to factory owners, supposedly to learn the textiles trade. They worked 12-hour shifts, and slept in barracks attached to the factory in beds just vacated by children about to start the next shift.

## Experiences of Ordinary Men, Women and Children

### Life in England

For the millions of people who left their country villages to come to the city, the Industrial Revolution seemed to promise good work and a good wage. In many cases, these hopes were quickly dashed. For most, work in this new world meant very long hours in dangerous conditions for inadequate pay. For others, the new cities offered only unemployment and poverty.

### The Industrial City

The Industrial Revolution created large cities and towns, in which the living conditions for ordinary people were very poor. The need to accommodate all of the new workers in the factories forced the rapid construction of cheap housing resulting in new suburbs of extremely poor quality. Government officials noticed these problems, and frequently sent observers to report on living conditions.

#### Factories

![|583x438](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXflemaXpDhr9z09_tdq_OPeGvY6xmAg4i3OuIjv9ObM9qmA3vyKRnGrfBWk1byKl13mKC6AMCAXzrOh4GZbqR7JqtvvIJT6ZeEPDaJMRwKqgHXu21nPvaPat18Nbo0DdExsM9Ak-g?key=_SQTa-WIr3ZkAzmF1RfLiy5W)

The new factories seemed enormous compared with the small workshops people were used to. We can see how they looked from the paintings of Eyre Crowe (see Source 2), who went to Wigan to study the people who worked in them.

This scene accurately shows known buildings such as the Victoria Mills, at the left of the scene, owned by the industrialist Thomas Taylor. Artists often sold their paintings to wealthy industrialists, who expected them to be accurate. The painting still has some limitations as a source for the historian. It only shows the factory girls resting, not working. They are taking a meal break, and seem happy and relaxed. They are well dressed, only one is barefoot, and clean and healthy.

A policeman patrols the street behind them, suggesting that everything is in order. The painter might have depicted a very different scene if he had gone inside the factory.

In most factories, people worked long hours and received low pay. If the workers demanded better wages, the owners dismissed them and took on other desperately poor workers instead. Moreover, the factory you see probably lacked safety equipment. The industrialists argued that safety equipment cost money but made no profits, so there was no point buying it. In the cotton mills, for example, young women like those in the painting worked for years in a factory where the air was full of fine cotton dust. When they breathed it in, it filled their lungs, causing lung disease and finally death. It was possible to buy large extractor fans to remove the cotton dust, but many industrialists argued that it was cheaper to hire new workers to replace those who died.

#### Child Labour

One of the worst problems in the new factory was the use of child labour. By law, a child was not allowed to work until the age of six, but few factory owners obeyed this rule.

Once they were employed, children worked very long hours. Those who fell asleep were whipped by their employers to stay awake; some were so exhausted they fell forward into the working machinery and were killed. In some factories, children were employed to use their small hands to clean out the machines while they were still operating, and many were injured when their hands got caught in the moving parts.

#### Warning Voices

Some of the strongest warning voices of the Industrial Revolution came from the industrialists themselves. Many were businessmen who believed that making profits was the only thing that mattered.

They thought social problems only occurred because working people were lazy or drunk. Others saw the truth. The Industrial Revolution itself was creating bad working conditions, low pay, bad housing, poverty and unemployment.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfEWt4JyWTd827x7rxV3HNdyv0Jb_Ce7-J5ZYfdhBelVZOc6Fc-D5sSjd5x703_hF5GVC5LWZlFqWbnPnZK1pAYHyj04OcacpEQSsEzAfsCt7mlOMqJFymwnzK2EPTH_mipABuB?key=_SQTa-WIr3ZkAzmF1RfLiy5W)

Robert Owen was a rare industrialist who bravely stated that bad working conditions were the main cause of the dirt, violence and crime in the industrial cities. He suggested that if owners improved the conditions in the factories, workers would also improve their behaviour.

To prove his point, he built a mill at New Lanark, near Glasgow in Scotland. He paid for large windows to let in light and air, plus proper toilets, drainage and even baths. He cut down working hours. He made sure that workers had free time, and encouraged them to read or to exercise during that time. He refused to employ children under the age of 10. He hoped that industrialists would see his successful factory and copy his reforms. When that did not happen, he went straight to the English parliament and persuaded Sir Robert Peel, the then Prime Minister, to pass laws to improve conditions in factories. He even showed working men how to form a trade union. He was so committed to reform that he spent his fortune on ideas to improve the lives of working people.

Workers often had to work long hours, in dangerous conditions, for a wage that was hardly enough to live on. Sometimes workers tried to go on strike, refusing to work until they were given better wages. The employers fought back by dismissals (getting rid of workers), lock-outs (shutting down their factories for a time) and importing labour (getting other workers from areas where there was unemployment). The workers fought back by forming trade unions, in which all members of a trade promised to strike together and support each other.

| Times Gone By . . . . .<br><br>In 1848, after revolutions had swept European countries such as France and Germany, the English novelist Elizabeth Gaskell decided to explain why she had written her novel Mary Barton (1848), with its sad and often alarming descriptions of the hardships of working-class life. She finishes by warning that if something was not done to help the workers, England might experience a revolution in the same way that France did.<br><br>I had always felt a deep sympathy with the care-worn men, who looked as if doomed to struggle through their lives going between work and poverty. A little expression of my sympathy, and the expression of the feelings of some of the working people who I knew, led them to lay their hearts open to me. I saw that they were sore and irritable against the rich. Whether the neglect which they experienced from the wealthy - especially from the masters whose fortunes they had helped to build - were fair is not for me to judge. This belief turns to revenge in too many of the poor uneducated factory-workers of Manchester. Whatever public effort can do in the way of laws, or private effort in the way of kind deeds, should be done as soon as possible.

| Betty Harris, age 37:<br><br>I was married at 23, and went into a colliery when I was married. I used to weave when about 12 years old; can neither read nor write. I work for Andrew Knowles, of Little Bolton (Lanes), and make sometimes 7s (shillings) a week, sometimes not so much. I am a drawer (moving coal carts in the mine), and work from 6 in the morning to 6 at night. Stop about an hour at noon to eat my dinner; have bread and butter for dinner; I get no drink. I have two children, but they are too young to work. I worked at drawing when I was in the family way. I know a woman who has gone home and washed herself, taken to her bed, delivered of a child, and gone to work again under the week.<br><br>I have a belt round my waist, and a chain passing between my legs, and I go on my hands and feet. The road is very steep, and we have to hold by a rope; and when there is no rope, by anything we can catch hold of. There are six women and about six boys and girls in the pit I work in; it is very hard work for a woman. The pit is very wet where I work, and the water comes over our clog-tops always, and I have seen it up to my thighs; it rains in at the roof terribly. My clothes are wet through almost all day long. I never was ill in my life, but when I was lying in.<br><br>My cousin looks after my children in the daytime. I am very tired when I get home at night; I fall asleep sometimes before I get washed. I am not so strong as I was, and cannot stand my work so well as I used to. I have drawn till I have bathe skin off me; the belt and chain is worse when we are in the family way. My feller (husband) has beaten me many a times for not being ready. I were not used to it at first, and he had little patience.<br><br>Source 5 – A woman miner’s evidence included in the Parliamentary Report on English Female miners, Great Britain.

### What Were the Short-term and Long-term Impacts of the Industrial Revolution?

As we have seen, the Industrial Revolution had many appalling short-term impacts. These included the exploitation of labour, grinding poverty and environmental damage. In the long term, the Industrial Revolution increased standards of living in the Western world and provided the infrastructure for modern urban society. It also facilitated globalisation. This involved the rise of international trade-the movement of goods and capital-and the more rapid spread of ideas through new forms of communication. Globalisation, however, had a negative side. It eroded some cultures, and was part and parcel of cultural imperialism. This is related to empire building.

### Global Changes in Landscapes, Transport and Communication

The Industrial Revolution not only changed the way goods were manufactured but also led to changes in the way land was used, as well as changes to transport and communication. Railways, steamships and the telegraph became commonplace.

## Convicts, Free Settlers and Slaves

### Transportation and Migration

The Enclosure Acts and the Industrial Revolution drove country people to the cities in the search for new forms of work. The population of Britain grew and the cities became more crowded. Conditions in the city deteriorated as streets were filled with garbage and sewage, and disease spread. The difference between the lives of the privileged rich and the despairing poor was probably greater at this time than any other period in British history. Approximately one-tenth of the English population, and one-quarter of the Irish population, were destitute.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdmhVVICHH4PxrvpBWkdQmjiYIKWgfnWaP-hi7I450Cqm13w6LhPN1J-E-xw3lxtV1gdg1H22wcpWLRCcd1I90VeIcqBVspV1zWzqT8pItAif2wOk8XY8Ekr-3bmSUGQKlLsLi8?key=tZNnXwgHKOHL3gM6Bl7JCbo1)

Children as young as six years of age mined the coal that was driving the engines of the Industrial Revolution and worked the factory mills that produced the cloth. Children continued to toil in the British mines until 1860.

Source 1 The 1751 painting Gin Lane by William Hogarth showed the violence and poverty of life in the streets of the late eighteenth-century slums of England’s cities.

### Convict Transportation

Without jobs and a future many people turned to crime. Their choice was between stealing or starving. At this time there was no organised police force and no real way of managing the serious social problems of eighteenth and nineteenth-century Britain. The British government responded to the crime wave by sentencing more criminals to death. Executions were carried out in public to act as a reminder to criminals of what would become of them if caught. By the early nineteenth century there were 200 different crimes punishable by death.

The other major form of punishment was transportation. Most of the convicts were people who had been found guilty of theft. After being sentenced to transportation, prisoners were chained in rat-infested convict ships, called hulks, until space was available on seaworthy transport vessels that would carry them across the globe.

During most of the eighteenth century, prisoners were usually transported to the Americas. The British government sold their convict labour to the American planters as a punishment, which also earned Britain money. The use of this criminal workforce in the Americas was disrupted by the revolution of 1776. Britain’s crushing defeat in the American War of Independence brought an end to North America as Britain’s criminal dumping ground.

The British government began a plan to ship her criminals to West Africa. Many were transported in leg irons on slave ships, bound for Africa’s coastal slave forts. Convicts were sent to West Africa to then work as convict-soldiers, assigned to guard captive Africans waiting to be sold into slavery. In 1781 murder and mutiny destroyed Britain’s West African plan for her banished criminals. The British government then decided to transport her convicts to the distant shores of the great south land, Australia.

### Free Settlers — Migration to Australia

The hardships of Industrial Revolution Britain created crime and a constant supply of convicts for transportation to Australia. It also created a large number of potential migrants. Hardship pushed people to look to the world beyond for the opportunity to build a better way of life. The government of the penal colony encouraged free settlers to make the long journey halfway around the world. Within five years, free settlers were arriving in the colony. They were given land grants by the governor and the use of convict labour to farm their properties. Between 1830 and 1850 over 200 000 people made the journey to Australia. They came of their own choice, and they came to stay.

| That the skilful farmer would be enabled to obtain an independent and comfortable subsistence is, however, indubitable; and the larger his family, provided they were of sufficient age to afford him an effectual co-operation, the greater would be his chance of a successful establishment. Hundreds of this laborious class of people, who in spite of unremitting toil and frugality, find themselves every day getting behind-hand with the world, would undoubtedly better their condition by emigrating to this colony, if there were only a probability that they would be enabled to go on from day to day as they are doing here. In this country they are at best but tenants of the soil they cultivate; whereas there they would be proprietors, and the mere advance which would be taking place in the value of their farms, would before many years not only render them independent but even wealthy …<br><br>  <br><br>For the artisan and mechanic, who are skilled in the works of utility, rather than luxury, there is, as it has been already remarked, no part of the world, perhaps, which affords an equal chance of success. To any, therefore, who have the means of transporting themselves and families to this colony, the removal would be in the highest degree advantageous. They could not fail to find immediate employment, and receive a more liberal return for their labour, than they would be able to procure elsewhere. The blacksmith, carpenter, cooper, stone-mason, brick-layer, brick-maker, wheel and plough-wright, harness-maker, tanner, shoe-maker, taylor, cabinet-maker, ship-wright, sawyer, &c. &c. would very soon become independent, if they possessed sufficient prudence to save the money which they would earn.<br><br>  <br><br>The advantages, however, which the colony offers to this class of emigrants, great as they undoubtedly are, when considered in an isolated point of view, are absolutely of no weight when placed in the balance of comparison against those which it offers to the capitalist, who has the means to embark largely in the breeding of fine woolled sheep.<br><br>  <br><br>Source 3 In 1819 the explorer and politician W.C.

Sixteenth-century Europe established a global trade network. This international trade made it possible for valuable products such as maize, sugar, silver, coffee, tobacco and cotton to be purchased in European marketplaces. Europeans were at the centre of this world trade because they built great ocean-going fleets of trade ships, and they controlled the vast plantations and mines producing these valuable goods.

The Spanish were the first Europeans to take land in the Americas for mining and farming. Sugar was in great demand in Europe and so planters established vast holdings in the Caribbean and South America. Plantation work was long and hard. Native Americans died in their millions from the unhealthy conditions they worked under, and from the effects of the diseases spread by the European settlers. The Spanish and Portuguese colonists looked for alternative sources of labour and found African slaves who could meet the demands of American agriculture and mining. The slave trade to the Americas was pioneered by the Portuguese who used African slaves on their plantations in the Cape Verde Islands, off the coast of west Africa, and in the Madeira Islands located in the Atlantic. The British soon joined the slave trade because of the huge profits that could be made.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfJYn68zf4kD5sz0buusA634RqNzgCpoE4TGY6XOZP3WHxwdZpEKoGKNNJAGLKwwIvJfq4JV-PJwLu2KVvr-VME5g5kvE-lGx9LBt547FqDXoI-icADafnD0PCxupmlShHinQ3hIg?key=tZNnXwgHKOHL3gM6Bl7JCbo1)

By the eighteenth century the cheap labour provided by millions of African slaves was allowing Europeans to prosper. Slave traders were among the richest people in eighteenth-century Britain.

### The Triangular Trade

As the numbers of European settlers across the Americas steadily increased, the ‘Triangular Trade’ developed (see source 6). Ships laden with European goods sailed to Africa, collected a cargo of slaves and then sailed back to Europe with valuable American trade goods such as sugar and cotton. The Atlantic crossing between Africa and the Americas was called the Middle Passage.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdI5AK0qOVy9K-p7zJomcv2--b-PxT395stqZJZcldkqTiTIbi6ty30dDQACesWwDkNaF1fsMTljHMEUnmU18f3x2dihbn4TsNLdj3OJTUXhXFxcZO8t90Rpyi-2oJXqzkUjN9J?key=tZNnXwgHKOHL3gM6Bl7JCbo1)

### Slaves to Industry

The wealth from the slavery of the American plantations helped to build the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain. Much of the British technology that changed the world was developed from the profits made by slave traders. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the British government received millions of pounds in revenue from the slave trade, and the taxes and duties that accompanied it.

The goods produced by approximately six million slaves working the fertile soils of America, Cuba and Brazil continued to stimulate the commercial growth of Europe. By the end of the eighteenth century, approximately 60 thousand slaves were transported each year to the Americas. Two and a half million slaves were employed at any one time in the production of sugar, tobacco and cotton.

Technology developed in the Industrial Revolution made slave labour even more productive:

The development of the steam engine increased the efficiency of sugar plantations in Cuba, as horses were replaced by machinery. The sugar mills operated non-stop, and were worked by slaves on 18-hour shifts.

In 1807 the British Parliament passed an act making it illegal for British ships to carry slaves, or for British colonies to import slaves. Despite the abolition of slavery, the profits from the trade continued to flow into the marketplaces of Britain. The southern states of America depended on the wealth that came from slave labour for their development, and refused to abolish the slave trade. Spain and Portugal also refused to abolish slavery and so the trade continued until the end of the nineteenth century.

Slaves bought in Africa produced sugar on plantations in the Caribbean that fed people in Europe, including by the eighteenth century workers who were making England’s industrial revolution and providing goods that people across the world wanted to buy.

English planters made their fortunes in the colonies and then returned to Britain and a life of luxury:

- William Beckford was a plantation owner in Jamaica. Upon his return to Britain he became the Lord Mayor of London, known for his lavish dinner parties.
- Famous businesses such as Barclays Bank and The Phoenix Insurance Company were established from profits from slave plantations.
- Britain’s Prime Minister Gladstone invested the wealth made from his plantations to build his trade empire, which included the Liverpool to Manchester railway.
- London slave traders invested their fortunes in the newly developing industries, such as the manufacturing of textiles. During this period the city of Manchester became known as Cottonopolis, the city of cotton, because of the huge quantity of fabric manufacturing.

## Free Settlers to the New World

Unlike the convicts and slaves, free settlers moved willingly to start new lives. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, North America, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa were seen as offering abundant land, although no consideration was given for the displacement of Indigenous peoples. In some cases, free grants of land were made. Even when land was not free, prices were usually low, and this was possibly the greatest factor that pulled new immigrants towards these places. The discovery of gold in North America and Australia also led to a dramatic shift in population. In 1750, Europe's population was 163 million, and it grew to 408 million by 1900. Over the same period, North America's population rose rapidly from 2 million to 82 million.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXczSIXHwglkEgZUEDFbkKPzsYXqsJyCRVlY-STzzO-6EAJumG97rhpag-eyjJNHpA0ZpNDt2QlpMKJ0muF6wG6OntUuQL39wdXSxsEUoT-pfcYxso8bx985l5HZBvOgXYK-8kCG?key=7swA_TLspcop97OMhZyVi5B2)

### North America

The British colonies in what we now know as the United States of America fought a war in the eighteenth century (the American War of Independence) to break free of British control. The chance to be a part of a new nation was a powerful 'pull' factor in drawing new immigrants. It led to a period of European expansion, as people moved west across the country, developing new settlements and trade routes. All these changes created more employment and opportunities for Europeans to own land. By the late nineteenth century, Canada, also a British colony, was starting to open up. Like the United States, it had large areas of land available. To encourage development of the west, land was given free to European settlers along the route of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

In 1848, gold was discovered in California, sparking the first gold rush. People from around the world went to the west coast of North America seeking instant wealth, and settled in the new territories (which were not yet part of the United States). Around 300 000 people arrived in California over the next five years, transforming the area. This was followed by a Colorado gold rush in 1859, causing the population of the western region of North America to grow rapidly. A couple of smaller gold rushes also hit Canada around this time, ending with the big Klondike gold rush in the Yukon in 1897.

Because of these gold rushes, North America became known as a land of opportunity. The idea of a prosperous democracy was a powerful 'pull' factor for many Europeans, who had seen their lives become worse during the changes of the Industrial Revolution.

### Australian Colonies

By the 1820s, although convicts and former convicts still made up the largest segment of the population of Australia, there were growing numbers of free settlers arriving. The need for workers had increased as land exploration opened up the continent.

Some settlers were part of a new group of 'assisted migrants', whereby employers could apply for financial assistance to bring workers to Australia if they had a particular skill that was needed. This approach would also be used to boost immigrant numbers in the twentieth century.  

As in the United States, the discovery of gold helped transform Australia. In 1848, mineralogist William Tipple Smith discovered gold near Bathurst in New South Wales, and the gold rush began in 1851. Between 1850 and 1860 the population of Australia almost tripled, from 405 400 to 1 145 600. 

Among those who came to Australia during the gold rush era were a second wave of Chartists and other political refugees. There was a perception that, in Australia, there was  a greater opportunity to think and speak freely, practise one's chosen religion and express differing political views. Many stayed to become settlers in the new nation that would emerge with Federation in 1901.

## Convict Transportation from Britain

As we have learnt, growing populations across Europe, and the movement of people from rural villages to rapidly developing towns and cities, resulted in a massive increase in crime rates in Britain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. There was serious competition for available jobs, housing, food and services (such as access to doctors). For some, petty crime was an easy way to earn a living, while for others it was a necessity - a case of steal or starve. Most criminals were poor, unskilled and uneducated. There was little understanding of rehabilitation, so the only response to this growth in criminal activity was punishment. In the late eighteenth century, at least 200 crimes were punishable by execution, including murder, treason and theft of valuable goods.

Those who escaped the death penalty were imprisoned in overcrowded jails, where conditions were far worse than even the poorest slums. When jails became so overcrowded that they could not hold any more prisoners, a new solution had to be found. Rather than building new prisons, criminals were imprisoned on ships that were no longer considered seaworthy. These 'hulks', as they were known, were moored in British harbours and filled with so many prisoners that they were even more cramped and unhealthy than the jails (see Source 1). It was also more difficult to make them secure, so riots and escapes were a constant problem.

In eighteenth-century Britain, new theories for treating and dealing with criminals became popular. One theory in particular was widely supported - that crimes could be stopped by the removal of the 'criminal class' from the wider population. In line with this theory, convicts were first sent to British colonies in North America, such as Virginia and

Maryland. This continued until Britain lost control of these colonies in 1783, after the American War of Independence. It was at this time that Joseph Banks, the botanist who had sailed with James Cook to Australia and the South Pacific in 1770, suggested Botany Bay on the coast of New South Wales as a good location for a new penal colony.

*STRANGE BUT TRUE*

Examples of people who were executed in the late eighteenth century include an admiral killed by firing squad for 'not doing his utmost' in a battle; one man burned at the stake for forgery; and another hanged for 'playing cards with a forged ace of spades·.

### The Penal Colony of New South Wales

The First Fleet of ships left Britain carrying over 700 convicts on the six-month journey to New South Wales in 1787 (see Source 6). Arriving at Botany Bay on 18 January 1788, it soon became clear that the area was unsuitable for colonisation, so the fleet moved on to Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), landing at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788.

### Other Penal Colonies

Other penal colonies in Australia were later established in Tasmania, at Port Phillip in Victoria, on the Swan River in Western Australia, at Moreton Bay in Queensland, and on Norfolk Island. For more than 80 years, convicts and ex-convicts provided the labour force that helped to develop these Australian colonies by building roads and houses, and clearing dense forests.

### Political Prisoners

![|304x435](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdOG-sm1EkNK-cQIX0dgVduathSulO2s5NjdU_SbXKaOluNn_84mnd2nTqzLkH9WK8W6xQFnRzV08OAoVMp6Ewni9TVnjFH72gOE72-EcnSnm4DI191ZyprSNge7EPYoq7124Cb?key=ZA4x8MtEUyASfIZgQ-OAI3uJ)

A significant category of convicts transported to Australia was made up of political prisoners. These were people who had criticised the king or opposed the authority of the government in some way. Workers who formed the first trade unions were among those sent to the colonies. One such group - six agricultural labourers from the English village of Tolpuddle had set up a union to bargain for wages with local landowners.

They were convicted in 1834 of 'swearing a secret oath' and transported to Australia for seven years. However, the men became popular heroes, and only two years into their sentence they were pardoned and returned to England. For their sacrifice, they earned the title the 'Tolpuddle Martyrs'.

Source 2 Detail from a public poster that cautioned against attending or joining unions

Other political prisoners included:

- **Luddites**
- **Chartists**, who were linked to trade unions and who proposed a People's Charter to give all men the vote and to stop the wealthy from dominating the political process. Chartists played a crucial role in the development of representative democracy in the Australian colonies.

Who were the convicts?

The story of Australia's convict past has often been contested by different historians, academics and everyday people, largely as a result of our uneasy relationship with how it defines us as a country today. This contestability is the result of two ideas working against each other:

- **The desire to forget or cover up the past** - Up until the 1960s, it was common for Australians with transported convict ancestors to hide the fact, because it was considered a stain on the family name. South Australia has always emphasised that, unlike the rest of Australia, it was settled as a free colony; while Van Diemen's Land - which was established as a place to send the most hardened convicts - changed its name to Tasmania in 1856 to remove the association with its past.
- **The desire to mythologise or romanticise the past** - To this day, it is common for certain convicts and settlers from Australia's past to be singled out and held up as examples of people who triumphed over adversity, such as Francis Greenway (a convicted forger who went on to become Australia's first government architect) and Isaac Nichols (a convicted thief who later set up Australia's first post office).

Historians have differing views of the convicts and the kind of people that they were. Some argue that political prisoners protesting against corruption and unfair government policies were not criminals at all, and that the law-breakers who did commit crimes were merely the victims of poverty and harsh laws. Other historians suggest that the convicts were, in reality, hardtflened criminals, and that half to two-thirds of them were repeat offenders who chose a life of crime even though other work was available.

The most common offences that resulted in transportation to Australia after 1788 included pick-pocketing, sheep- and horse-stealing, highway robbery and burglary. Many convicts were from newly industrialised cities, and research has shown that 40 per cent of the convicts transported to Australia in the First and Second Fleets came from the London area. Not all those convicted of a crime were transported. Generally, transportation was reserved for those under 50 years of age who had been convicted more than once. Statistics show that, until 1851, around 30 per cent of the convicts were under 19 years of age.

## Impacts of European Settlement on Aboriginal People

### Impact on the Eora People of Sydney

The founding of the convict settlement of Sydney directly resulted in the dispossession of Aboriginal people. Over 30 separate Aboriginal clans had lived in the Sydney region for at least 40 000 years. One of these clans, the Gadigal people, came from the south shore of Sydney Harbour, in the area from Watsons Bay to Sydney Cove. It was the Gadigal people who witnessed the 1788 arrival of the First Fleet at Sydney Cove.

The arrival of the British began the process that saw the Gadigal lose their lands and their self-sufficient, hunting and gathering way of life. The Gadigal and other coastal Aboriginal people in this area were known as the Eora. They lived well on the harbour's fish, oysters, mussels and cockles. The foreshores provided plenty of vegetables, grubs, possums, wombats and kangaroos. The arrival of the British brought competition for clean water and food, and introduced fatal European diseases. The new arrivals cut down trees, desecrated sacred sites, stole Aboriginal spears and fishing lines, polluted waterholes and rapidly extended their control of the land.

Governor Arthur Phillip was under British orders to establish good relations with the indigenous people, so he commanded that 'the natives should not be offended or molested on any account'. The Eora shouted 'Wona worra', meaning 'Go away', but then extended hospitality to the newcomers. The first exchanges between Eora and Europeans on the beaches of Sydney were friendly; beads, mirrors, cloth and gestures of goodwill were exchanged. The newcomers and the traditional owners of the land laughed, joked and danced together.

|Tuesday 29 January 1788 - Landed on a point forming the NW or middle branch to which we were followed by several of the natives along the rocks, having only their sticks which they use in throwing the lance with them. A man followed at some distance with a bundle of lances; they pointed with their sticks to the best landing place and met us in the most cheerful manner, shouting and dancing. The women kept at a distance near the man with the spears.<br><br>  <br><br>This mark of attention to the women, in showing us that although they met us unarmed they had arms ready to protect them, increased my favourable opinion of them very much.<br><br>  <br><br>A.M. Went over to Shell Cove and left this branch, taking it as reported by those who examined it when the boats first came into this harbour. As we left this branch we met several canoes with one man in each of them; they had so much confidence in us as to come close alongside our boats. After fixing the place of the rock and extent of the shoalwater round it we went into the north arm.<br><br>  <br><br>As we were going into the first cove on the east side called Spring Cove, we were joined by three canoes with one man in each. They hauled their canoes up and met us on the beach leaving their spears in the canoes. We were soon joined by a dozen of these and found three amongst them with trinkets &c. hanging about them that had been given to them a week before by the governor on his first visit to this place. Our people and these mixed together and were quite sociable, dancing and otherwise amusing them. One of our people combed their hair with<br><br>which they were much pleased; several women appeared at a distance, but we could not prevail on the men to bring them near us.<br><br>  <br><br>We had here an opportunity of examining their canoes and weapons: the canoe is made of the bark taken off a large tree of the length they want to make the canoe, which is gathered up at each end and secured by a lashing of strong vine which runs amongst the underbrush. One was secured by a small line . . . .<br><br>  <br><br>The governor's plan with respect to the natives was, if possible, to cultivate an acquaintance with them without their having an idea of our great superiority over them, that their confidence and friendship might be more firmly fixed. We could not persuade any of them to go away in the boat with us.<br><br>  <br><br>SOURCE 1 Account of the first British impressions of the Eora by William Bradley, first Lieutenant on the Sirius.|

Behind British goodwill was the clear intention to establish a British prison on Aboriginal land. Within a week of arrival, the British had cleared trees, built the Governor's small cottage and planted a vegetable garden. By 1790 the Eora had names for the uninvited visitors - Berewalgal - people from a distant land. The early attempts at establishing friendly relationships began to fail when the clash over land and culture began.

#### A Battle for Survival

The sudden arrival of over 1000 Berewalgal, who did not respect traditional land boundaries and claimed all the Eora land for themselves, placed a huge burden on the limited resources of the area. By the first winter of 1788 the Eora communities were beginning to experience hardship and hunger as the colonists took the best land and the Eora were forced onto the lands of neighbouring clans to hunt and gather food. The battle for survival had begun.

|   |
|---|
|In December 1788 a group of convicts reported a hostile encounter with a large band of warriors. Governor Phillip feared that relations with the Eora were steadily deteriorating and decided that communication had to be established. The new strategy was to kidnap Eora men, teach them English and send them back to their communities as goodwill ambassadors. Twelve days later an Eora man, Arabanoo, was kidnapped from Manly Beach. He quickly learnt to speak English but died within a year from the smallpox epidemic, called gal-gal-Ja by the Eora.|

#### The Spread of Disease

Smallpox spread rapidly and devastated the Eora people. Convict work gangs reported seeing the effects of the disease in April, 1789. Bodies covered in sores were being found in caves or lying unattended at abandoned camp sites. In May, Captain John Hunter noted the absence of the usual signs of Eora daily life around Sydney Cove. Arabanoo, an Eora man who had been taken captive and learned to speak English, was taken down to the harbour to make contact with his family. He found no-one. According to the eyewitness report of David Collins:

|   |
|---|
|'... not a living person was anywhere to be met with. It seemed as in flying from contagion they had left the dead to bury the dead. He lifted up his hands and eyes in silent agony for some time; at last he exclaimed 'All dead! All dead!' and then hung his head in mournful silence'.|

Arabanoo and the colony surgeon nursed the Eora brought to a camp hospital set up to treat the smallpox victims. Arabanoo caught smallpox from his patients and died on 18 May 1789.

The origin of the disease remains uncertain. An Aboriginal smallpox-marked face was not seen at the time of the first European settlement; and yet during the second half of 1789, the terrible path of the disease could be traced right across Port Jackson, Broken Bay and the Hawkesbury regions. There were no recorded cases of smallpox outbreaks on the First Fleet ships. Some suggested it had come from Macassan fishermen to Australia's north. Others suggested that it had come as smallpox scabs left stuck to the blankets and old clothing given as gifts to the Eora. Whatever the source of the disease, the impact on Aboriginal people was catastrophic. In just over a year, well over half the Eora people of the Sydney region were dead.

### European Settlement Expands

As the quantity of harbour fish dwindled and as vegetable supplies were eaten out, the colonists began to hunt and fish in the lands beyond their immediate settlement. The rapid expansion of European settlement continued after the departure of Governor Phillip in 1792, to the land that stretched from Sydney to the foot of the Blue Mountains. This was the land of the Dharug people. The lagoons and creeks of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River and the open grasslands of the plains provided the Dharug with their source of life and culture. The Dharug required a large enough area in which to move about, hunting kangaroos, possums, fish and other animals, and gathering seasonal food such as yams. When the British cleared the land for agriculture, housing and industry, the loss of traditional Aboriginal food sources was complete.

By the 1810s the plains of Sydney had become overcrowded. With the crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813, the search for more pastoral land pushed the frontier of European colonisation into the north-west of New South Wales. European settlement spread into the land of the Kamilaroi, Muruwari and Wailwan people. Along the traditional paths of communication between Aboriginal communities, word spread of the pale strangers who came on unusual beasts.

The British government continued to give land grants to settlers and to big pastoral companies, because sheep farming and wool made huge profits. By 1824, it was clear to the Kamilaroi people of northern New South Wales that the European settlers intended to:

- take possession of the land
- deny Aboriginal people access to the waterholes
- destroy traditional hunting and gathering grounds
- disregard traditional law and sacred sites.

### Losing the Land

The nineteenth-century experience of the Eora and the Kamilaroi peoples was repeated across the continent. The Kamilaroi people were given no compensation or payment for the 223 000 hectares of their land taken by the Australian Agricultural Company in the 1830s. The Kamilaroi were allowed to stay on their land only if employed by the company as stockmen or as domestic servants.

By 1860, the European settlement covered over 400 million hectares of Aboriginal land. As immigrant populations expanded across Australia, Aboriginal people were increasingly left on the outskirts of settlement.

Many Aboriginal people worked on pastoral properties or took refuge on reserves and missions, which were places established for religious conversion or social improvement. European missionaries were inspired to bring Christianity to the Aboriginal people on the missions. They aimed to save the souls of the Aboriginal people by turning them away from their languages and cultural practices. The missions did provide people with basic health and educational services, and some protection from the cruelty and exploitation of the towns and large pastoral properties.

Between 1860 and 1910, laws were passed to 'protect' and separate Aboriginal people from the European population. Aboriginal people were forced from their traditional land and onto the reserves and missions. In New South Wales, the Aborigines Protection Board was established in 1883 to implement the government policy that all 'full-blood' Aboriginal people should live on the 25 New South Wales reserves.

People were encouraged to establish farms on the reserves so that they could become self-sufficient. However, the reserves were located away from towns and on areas of land too small to allow Aboriginal communities to support themselves.

## The Experiences of Slaves

Slaves were kidnapped from the north-west coast of Africa - from places such as Guinea (a French colony) or Gold Coast (a British colony). Slave catchers used rope nets to capture young Africans. Often, they were captured while they were out hunting, and their families would never have known what happened to them. They were herded into cages and then loaded onto slave ships.

The conditions under which slaves were shipped to the Americas were brutal. The quarters for the slaves below the decks were little more than leaking, ocean-going dungeons. In summer, the heat was stifling. In winter, the slaves - with little clothing and no blankets or bedding - would shiver with cold. It was almost impossible for slaves to find a comfortable position because of overcrowding and the fact that they were in chains. Much of the time, they were forced to lie in their own urine and excrement. The only relief might come when small groups were allowed briefly on deck, while still in chains, to be hosed down with sea water.

The slaves were fed the bare minimum of food required to keep them alive, in order to reduce costs and maximise profits. They also had only limited access to fresh water.

Many slaves attempted escape during the journey, or tried to end their misery by jumping overboard. Some also refused to eat. Slave-ship captains responded by ordering crew

members to smash the teeth of those troublesome slaves, and force-feed them. Slavers also used a special tool, like a pair of pliers, called the speculum oris. The pointed ends were jabbed

between the jaws of the unfortunate slave and then, with the turn of a screw, the ends opened and forced their jaws apart, sometimes breaking their teeth.

Source 1 An illustration from The Illustrated London News, 20 June 1857, shows how slaves were packed together on board slave ships. They were often forced into painful postures, with barely enough room to turn.

It was common for rebellious slaves to have their hands cut off, and then their heads. The severed body parts were then passed around to other slaves below deck as a warning. For some African tribes, the severing of their heads was the worst imaginable fate, as they believed that without their heads, their spirits would never find their way home. In one terrible case, a newborn baby - whose slave mother had died in childbirth on a slave ship - was left out in the sun to die, and later thrown overboard. The captain was found not guilty of murder because there had been no 'premeditated malice'. The court ruled that he had not planned for the woman to die, and that without a mother the child would have died anyway.

|I was soon put down under the decks, and there I received such a greeting in my nostrils as I had never experienced in my life; so that, with the loathsomeness of the stench, and crying together, I became so sick and low that I was not able to eat, nor had I the least desire to taste anything. I now wished for the last friend, death, to relieve me; but soon, to my grief, two of the white men offered me eatables; and, on my refusing to eat, one of them held me fast by the hands, and laid me across, I think, the windlass, and tied my feet, while the other flogged me severely . . . The white people looked and acted, as I thought, in so savage a manner; for I had never seen among my people such instances of brutal cruelty . . . The closeness of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in the ship, which was so crowded that each had scarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us . . . The air soon became unfit for respiration, from a variety of loathsome smells, and brought on a sickness among the slaves, of which many died . . . This wretched situation was again aggravated by the . . .  chains, now . . .  unsupportable, and the filth of the necessary tubs, into which the children often fell, and were almost suffocated.

### Arrival in the Americas

When the slave ships docked at one of the American ports, the slaves were unloaded and prepared for auction. Sores and wounds were covered with tar to make them less visible, and troublesome slaves were given laudanum (made from opium) to sedate them. The slaves were paraded like animals before the interested buyers. Potential purchasers would examine them thoroughly, look in their mouths, feel their muscles, and even comment on their ability as potential breeders of more slaves. The entire process was dehumanising and undignified, and the slaves had no idea where they were or what was ahead of them.

The experiences of African slaves in the Americas varied according to when they were transported, what skills or physical attributes they had, where they were sent, and who bought them. The majority of slaves brought to the southern states of North America and the West Indies worked on plantations and farms. They were given new names, and usually went by the surnames of their masters. They worked long hours in the cotton, sugar or tobacco fields, and lived in simple huts with few comforts. Slaves also worked in the house, and tended animals and vegetable patches. Female slaves were often at the mercy of male members of the household, and the illegitimate children of these masters were also born into slavery.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdY8SpTXPA769gtZ-z4bTzQ9HZE0gH7BN1ln_2KsErWg0bZAC5IsMfU2PEPOiQL0L7698zytxC7rfzSK8t4dLFJDRW00KWWeLpY42inu6m5v4tn6SuYTI_2DZG_--BsLuwuVgcxug?key=ZchPHqh2LmSMS71dZ4D_CWDU)

Slaves who tried to escape were severely punished. Whipping was common for those who were caught, and repeat offenders could have their teeth filed into points so that it was obvious to all that this slave was troublesome.

Source 6 The scarred back of a slave - the result of a brutal series of whippings

Under American law slaves were always considered to be property, not human beings.

For example:

- Under the law, slaves could be bought and sold by their owners, and separated from their families.
- Slaves were not allowed to own property of their own, and were not allowed to leave their master's land without permission.
- Laws were passed that made it illegal for slaves to learn to read or write.
- Slaves were not allowed to be out after dark or join with groups of other slaves, except for supervised work or church.
- Slaves were never allowed to hit or challenge a white person, but a white person could kill a slave while punishing them without breaking the law.
- The slave owners attempted to wipe out any memory the slaves had of their African heritage.

There were exceptions, however. Some slave owners taught their slaves to read and write (because it benefited them to do so). There were also slave owners who would never sell or separate families, and others who set their slaves free when the slaves reached retirement age. Many slaves managed to preserve memories of their African heritage, parts of their traditional languages and stories from their past. The music they brought with them from Africa would also survive and become a major contributor to twentieth-century American culture.

In the twenty-first century, an ongoing debate in American society and politics regarding reparations (payment of compensation) for the injustices of slavery has continued to divide Americans. This is important, as much of the American economic system and wealth was built by slaves who never got to share this wealth. Also, many slaves made great inventions throughout this period that became the property of and were patented by their owners, whose wealth was further increased at the expense of the slaves.

These patents are still held by slave owners' families, and reparation has not been made to the descendants of the slaves.

## The Translatlantic Slave Trade

Slavery is as old as human history. It was a feature of life in the ancient world, and also a feature of African history even before the arrival of the Europeans. Traditionally, African tribal leaders made slaves of their captured enemies, although they stayed in their own country and could buy their way out of slavery.

From the 1600s onwards, the European powers began to exploit African resources. This meant looking to Africa for trade goods, territory, and human cargo in the form of slaves. During the 1700s, Britain became a major player in the trade that had previously been dominated by the Portuguese and the Spanish. Britain's participation in the slave trade was driven by the profit motive - merchants were happy because their ships were full (and thus earning money) on each of the three legs of the triangular trade route. At the end of each leg, merchants' profits increased. The slaves they captured in Africa were sold for profit in the Americas, and raw materials such as sugar, tobacco and, later, cotton were taken on board. These were then shipped to Europe for sale. In Europe, cheap manufactured goods were loaded on board and carried back to Africa for sale at a profit.

The pursuit of profit, along with a sense of European superiority, ensured that the slave trade grew rapidly. It lasted until 1833 in the British Empire and until 1863 in the United States.

By the end of the eighteenth century, up to 12 million Africans had been taken as slaves to the West Indies, South America and Britain's American colonies. The size of the slave trade was not just the result of the desire for cheap labour, as the number of sugar, tobacco and cotton plantations increased in the Americas. It was also due to the high premature death rate among slaves. This meant that more slaves were always needed to maintain the size of the workforce.

Source 1 Shackled slaves being put in the hold of a slave ship bound for the Americas.

Unlike convicts, who could have opportunities in a new land after completing their sentences, slaves had very little to look forward to. Slavery usually lasted for life, and a slave's children were born into slavery. These children were often the result of European sexual abuse of women in slavery.

### Transportation of Slaves

Perhaps the most notorious leg of the transatlantic slave trade was the 'middle passage'. This was the section of the journey in which slaves were transported from Africa, across the Atlantic Ocean, to the Americas. The journey lasted anywhere from one to six months.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdnj5oUlbX1JHbvzKggX6DBhp4z1pbQSxRWaVpQbBu-d8pkte7cfghNqsZF5JGh9FRZ1AvlCSwpRsMbPpb_rWDK0nP4EUL9M2boOzDGnC82HK-LoTUBLvvp1lOgZonl7QIlBnrV2A?key=qEYuZc1UAgcPrjPVU09Q0k4U)Source 2 A plan of the British slave ship Brookes in 1789, showing how 454 slaves were loaded in accordance with the 'tight pack' method following the Slave Regulation Act of 1788. Before the Act, the 'tight pack· method would have meant the ship carried up to 740 slaves.

Slaves were packed below deck, often in chains, where they were forced to lie side by side in cramped conditions with little headroom. Slave ship companies went to great lengths to find the best way of 'packing' their human cargo for shipment. In terms of their business model, the 'best way' was of course the most profitable way, but there was debate about how they could achieve this. Some favoured the 'loose pack' method, arguing that by giving slaves a little more room, not as many would die from the appalling conditions.

Those slaves who did survive the 'loose pack' would also arrive in better condition and fetch a higher price at the slave markets. Others favoured the 'tight pack' method, with many more slaves loaded onto a single ship. It was argued that even if some died or reached the Americas in poor health, there would still be more slaves to sell. 'Tight pack' was generally more popular, on the basis of profits. Of course, it did not take into account the price of human suffering.

## The Lives of Free Settlers in Australia

Settlers, squatters and selectors

Early settlers in Australia came in search of a better life, or to make their fortune. Some settlers had agricultural backgrounds, but others, such as the military officers who were given large land grants, had no farming experience.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXebC4K9KzuPgSAVrFFrCDDcHxZq-9TDmp71zslboYnZ4cpGSAnqontTRegcAoNCWfwa3XjANQGZLCCwlssfEuOWM6NFnY6-3BI7qY_eFhAMnqQatlcUOxZTyu3II2AvlaGVW4vFGA?key=oOEGvgofKdDPW4NCdflbR_Ts)

Squatters were settlers who cleared stretches of Crown land and occupied them with their sheep and cattle, without official ownership. They lived on the frontiers, far away from government regulation and supplies. Squatters were often the first Europeans to explore parts of inland Australia, and chose the most fertile land to settle on. The government later

gave licences to squatters, allowing them to lease the land they already occupied. Some squatters became very wealthy and were the pioneers of Australia's wool industry.

In the 1860s, the governments of the Australian colonies dispossessed Aboriginal people and sold blocks of land that they had previously leased to squatters. The new settlers who bought small areas of land to farm were known as selectors. Wealthy squatters purchased most of the fertile land they had cleared and worked, and selectors were often left with the poorest farming land without easy access to water.

The life of settlers in Australia could be harsh. Even with the help of convict labour and Aboriginal people who may have been able to stay on their traditional lands in return for unpaid work, it could take years to clear their land of trees, and establish their crops and livestock. Food was scarce, and settlers initially lived in basic bark shelters, or built 'wattle and daub' huts made of tree branches and clay.

The lives of early Australian settlers

Source 1

[T]he selector's ... stock of ready money is usually exhausted by the time he has ringed and felled a few trees upon the site of his future homestead, erected a hut of slabs and bark, furnished it with a trestle bed and blankets, a rudely-constructed table and bench, a few cooking utensils, an axe, a spade, a crosscut saw, and a supply of flour, tea and sugar ... and when he has broken up a few perches of land and put in his first crop, he is not unfrequently compelled to seek for work in the neighbourhood at fencing or road-making, in order to maintain himself until the 'kindly earth' shall have yielded him her increase [produce a crop] ... In some cases the free-selector, who is fortunate enough to be the possessor of a horse and to be quick and dextrous [skilled] in the use of the shears, sets out in the beginning of August for the woolsheds in the south of Queensland, or in the north of New South Wales, to fulfil a yearly engagement at sheep-shearing ... returning in time to gather in his own crops, and with cheques in his pocket representing at least a hundred pounds ... He is thus enabled to purchase a few head of stock or a better description of plough, to build a more commodious [spacious] hut, and to supply the wife and children, for whom he has been making a home in the bush, with such articles of wearing apparel [clothes] as they may stand in need. There is plenty of hard work and very little recreation in such a life ...

Each stockman's hut stood by itself in a clearing, leagues distant [miles away] from any other dwelling, and as far as might be from the nearest scrub, in the thickets of which the Blacks could always find an unassailable stronghold.

The settler depended for safety upon the keenness of his hearing, the excellence of his carbine [rifle], and the Blacks' superstitious dread of darkness, which makes them averse to leaving their camp except on moonlight nights, or with an illumination of burning firesticks.

Then there was a garden, fenced in with hurdles, over which our tame kangaroo took his daily constitutional [walk]; but nothing grew in it except pumpkins and fat-hen [a type of weed]. Well for us that they did flourish, for we lived on pumpkins and mutton for three months, during which time the drays were delayed by flooded creeks, and the store was empty of flour, tea, sugar, and all other groceries.

### The Gold Rush in Australia

The discovery of gold in 1848 at a sawmill in California sparked a gold rush that led to the spectacular growth of the west coast of the United States. As people flooded to the goldfields, San Francisco was transformed from a city of 1000 people in 1848 to more than 25 000 people by the end of 1849.

Edward Hargraves was one of the hopefuls who had travelled there. He was unsuccessful at finding his fortune in California; however, after returning to Australia he took advantage of the New South Wales Government's failure to acknowledge William Tipple Smith's 1848 find near Bathurst, west of Sydney, and claimed in 1851 that he had discovered gold in the same area. This well-publicised 'discovery' sparked the gold rush in Australia.

Living conditions were hard for everyone on the Australian goldfields. In places such as Bendigo, for example, around 40 000 people lived close together in tents. Water and fresh food were scarce. Garbage piled up around the diggings, and toilets were simply holes dug in the ground. The unsanitary conditions and poor diet led to diseases such as dysentery and typhoid. Most 'diggers' worked from dawn until dusk, six days a week.

It is estimated that more than 80 per cent of the population on goldfields were male, as women generally remained at home with their children. Some women did brave the difficult conditions to keep the family together, but they risked death or disease from the lack of sanitation and medical care. Children under the age of five made up the majority of deaths on the goldfields.

In the early years of the gold rush, most miners were able to make reasonable returns, and 'alluvial gold', which washed up in creek and river beds, was relatively easy to find. By the 1850s, however, much of the alluvial gold had already been found, and miners had to dig mine shafts to find veins of 'reef gold', which occurred many metres underground.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcI0Bjrl8T7HEmome-ivF0Cgwe_zpDluNeG1S-DmUE-Nq5_PpTwdyPOU6986k40n9EXzhGKFJtNUSBhlYejIGTadrhNDVxlggB72ZkXUsq1HMsek4KDw11m_QBkcZ226ihjRDN-fA?key=oOEGvgofKdDPW4NCdflbR_Ts)

All miners had to pay a licence fee, which was bitterly resented. It became one of the factors that contributed to the Eureka Rebellion in 1854.

# World War I

## The Origins of World War I

World War I had its origins in rival alliances, national competitiveness, an arms race and a climate of tension among the major powers — Austria–Hungary, Britain, France, Germany and Russia. Any issue among them that could not be resolved could lead to war. The European powers had spent years preparing for war and their peoples had come to think of war as a normal and likely occurrence.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXctzz3sqgDL7bXbF-Hj5gr9GSP3o8zXNN9KmoLzL_NmzHFecgw25fQ8G80T0c0CH2aqrZfii5emTCruY8Sw_h65RQiEBR947o9ZlhKFBG5PEh7Nmi2da1uZG0an70DhO8LOjS2fKA?key=azhkrE2_he9Ve7UzAdtxl3vX)

### Nationalism, War and Adventure

In the late nineteenth century, many Europeans had come to think of war as a heroic adventure in which they might one day have the chance to participate. Newspaper articles, cartoons, novels and songs presented a romantic image of war and the adventurous life of a man in uniform.

Governments encouraged nationalism and patriotism to unify people who often still felt more loyal to their local area than to their nation. Countries saw involvement in war as evidence of a nation’s maturity. Education encouraged and focused students’ attention on past wrongs and current threats that other European powers had or were supposedly inflicting on their nation.

Source 1 Photo showing boys in sailor suits, c.1900

People took pride in all things military. Parents dressed their young children in sailors’ suits and gave their sons toy soldiers to play with. In England, children eagerly awaited the fortnightly instalments of Robert Baden-Powell’s Scouting for Boys, which helped boys (and girls) learn many of the skills of resourcefulness, which he had previously used in training soldiers.

### Tensions and Rivalries

People saw war as the likely outcome of the rivalries among the great powers in the areas of:

- competition to take advantage of trading opportunities
- competition to control territory and resources in Africa that would give nations access to raw materials that weren’t available in Europe
- the development of weapons and ships that nations could use to protect their interests
- the size and strength of armies and navies and the arms race (especially between Britain and Germany) that resulted from this individual power and status.

### War Plans and the Arms Race

One nation’s attempts to protect its interests led others to fear its power. In 1898, Germany set out to create a navy twice the size of Britain’s. In 1906, Britain launched the HMS Dreadnought, considered  to be the most powerful ship afloat. German engineers were soon copying this design, leading to further tension:

- Britain feared Germany’s navy and the possibility of such a navy cutting Britain off from the rest of its empire.
- Germany argued that its navy was essential to protect its trade.

### The Alliance System

Increasing national rivalries within and beyond Europe resulted in nations forming two rival alliances. From 1907 onwards, the major powers were all members of one of these two rival and armed power blocs. Britain had joined with Russia and France in an alliance known as the Triple Entente, while Germany was linked with Austria–Hungary and Italy in the Triple Alliance.

These agreements increased nations’ sense of strength and protection and fostered the fear and mistrust of the nations that did not belong to them. They reflected the threat that the powers sensed from one another, and the desire to avenge past ‘wrongs’:

- Russia and Austria–Hungary competed with each other to extend their power in the area of south-eastern Europe known as the Balkans.
- France feared Germany’s army and sought revanche (revenge) for Germany taking the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine from France in 1871.

Between 1905 and 1913, tensions among the great powers increased as a result of crises in northern Africa and the Balkans. The great powers resolved these crises, although hostility generally increased among those involved.

Map showing the great powers and their alliances in 1907. Italy declared itself neutral when war broke out and, in April 1915, signed the Treaty of London committing it to fight in support of the Triple Entente.

### Assassination in Sarajevo

On 28 June 1914, at Sarajevo in Bosnia, 23-year-old Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist, shot dead the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his wife Sophie. Franz Ferdinand was the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. His assassination provided an excuse for Austria–Hungary to attempt to punish and weaken its long-time enemy, Serbia.

The ‘July crisis’ that developed from the assassination involved, through their alliances, all the major European powers and it ignited the tensions among them. Their failure to resolve the July crisis demonstrated nations’ desires to exercise their power and also their fears of one another (see source 5). By 4 August 1914, Europe was at war.

- Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne was assassinated on 28 June 1914 by Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip, shot at close range while being driven through Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, formally annexed by Austria-Hungary in 1908.
- Princip was part of a group of six Bosnian assassins, members of a student revolutionary group that later became known as Young Bosnia. The political objective of the assassination was to free Bosnia and Herzegovina of Austria-Hungarian rule.
- The assassination precipitated the July Crisis which led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia and the start of World War I.

### Significant People

Kaiser Wilhelm II

- Built up German army and navy
- Aggressive foreign policy
- Determined to make Germany a top nation.
- Distrusted by other powers

Count Berchtold

- Austrian Prime Minister
- During the July crisis, decided on a very tough ultimatum for Serbia.

Bethmann Hollweg

- Gave very strong support to Austria during the July crisis while Kaiser was cruising on his yacht

### Crisis

28 June 1914

- Heir to Austrian throne Franz Ferdinand visits Sarajevo.
- Capital of Bosnia, recently grabbed by Austria.
- Hotbed of Slav nationalism.
- "Black Hand" terrorists attack the Arch Duke.
- Gavrilo Princip shoots Archduke and his wife.
- Austrians blame Serbia for supporting terrorists.
- Austrians, supported by Germany, send Serbia a tough ultimatum.
- Russia mobilises her troops to support Serbia.
- Germany demands that Russia stands her armies down.
- Germany declares war on Russia.

### Why Did Britian Get Involved?

- Britain had Ententes with France and Russia.
- Only "friendly agreements" but French and Russians given impression Britain would fight.
- The Schlieffen Plan

### The Schlieffen Plan

- Germany's military plan to defeat France and Russia.
- "Knock out blow" aimed at France first.
- Avoid French defences by invasion of Belgium.
- Germans thought Britain would not intervene.

### Britain's Plan

- 1838 - UK had signed a Treaty to protect Belgium.
- Did not want Germany to defeat France and dominate Europe. Britain next?
- UK issued ultimatum to Germany to withdraw troops from Belgium. War declared August 4 1914

### Australia's Reaction

Australia would support Britain "to the last man and the last shilling."

- Australians seemed very eager to go to war.
- They tended to think of warfare as short, heroic and glorious.

## The Causes of WWI

- The war had a lot to do with a shifting balance of power in Europe
- Tensions arose through competition for colonies and resources. 
- Some countries were becoming stronger than others.
- In order to protect themselves, nations built up their military forces and formed alliances with other countries

In time two major alliances stood opposed to each other.  These were:

| The Triple Alliance | The Triple Entente |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Germany             | Britian            |
| Austria-Hungary     | France             |
| Italy               | Russia             |

The Triple Alliance was a formal agreement between the three countries to help defend each other from attack. The agreement was renewed yearly until the war began.

The Triple Entente (a French word meaning ‘friendship’ or ‘understanding) ‘was an informal agreement between the three countries to help each other.

### Assassination and Alliances

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdFnmLKsu-YyEVtCxL7NUZSB-T6k4ZEr-jrAhLaL-rgYn1vlkb1bJLmq1JXv9pwF5hZAdXEdfpWJOReJwpzaEWg5VMIHRriS4HbHEGZK3d5QyPk5YKmbvIvqDFDL8D0dOg8l5nHvw?key=FBL4Y7lapyme2_E3WmL8nVcu)

The spark to the conflict was the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand

- Austria blamed Serbia for the assassination and planned to attack it.
- Russia supported Serbia as they considered them to be slavic people like the Russians and were, therefore, historically related to the Russian people.
- Due to the Triple Entente, Russia was joined by Britain and France
- Germany chose to defend its ally Austria.

So:

1. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.
2. Russia warned Austria-Hungary not to attack Serbia and mobilised its forces against Austria-Hungary.
3. Germany warned Russia not to mobilise its forces against Austria-Hungary. When Russia refused, Germany declared war on Russia.
4. As part of its plan to win the war, Germany then declared war on France (as an ally of Russia).
5. To avoid the heavy defences on the border with France, Germany invaded France through Belgium.
6. Britain then declared war on Germany in support of Belgium and France, and on Turkey because of her alliance with Germany.
7. In the following months and years, other countries declared war, including:

- Austria on Russia
- Japan on Germany
- Austria on Japan
- USA on Germany
- USA on Austria-Hungary

This was now truly a world war.

### What about Italy?

Despite being one of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary prior to the war, Italy sensed that it would be advantageous to join with the Entente. At the start of the war in 1914, they remained neutral, then the following year, in 1915, they joined the Entente.

"The Chain of Friendship", an American editorial cartoon depicting the supposed web of alliances, captioned, "If Austria attacks Serbia, Russia will fall upon Austria, Germany upon Russia, and France and England upon Germany.”

The two sides that fought in WW1 were:

| The Allies                                            | The Central Powers |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Britain (Including its Empire)                        | Germany            |
| France                                                | Austria-Hungary    |
| Russia                                                | Ottoman Turkey     |
| Belgium                                               | Bulgaria (1915)    |
| Italy (1915)                                          |                    |
| USA (1917)                                            |                    |
| Serbia, Portugal, Japan<br>& other minor participants |                    |

The Great War lasted from 28 July, 1914, when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia (one month after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand) and lasted until 11 November, 1918 when an armistice was declared between the warring parties.

### Results of “The Great War”

- 65 million men were mobilised
- 9  million soldiers were killed, died of wounds or sickness
- 21 million soldiers were wounded
- 17 million civilians were estimated to have been killed
- Huge destruction of property

## Long Term Causes - The Path to War

Though World War I began in 1914, its causes can be traced back to tensions and suspicions which had developed over a great number of years. The path to war involved nationalism, militarism, imperialism and alliances.

### The Path To War

#### Militarism

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfAmhEcDEtkS1aSB665T3resduu_9TZxuJp9ZgsQMqKXzAdO6idhcP_GJwG-VybQMb9_xHLdnL5tjnfqjDwnKP0_YqRLRC7wCrwBW0y5Hh1GQjDK7lmKaUJ8m_fo9LsqkItGc8w?key=W30t-2KSZySPiW3RRK04rOxl)

Militarism is a policy of developing powerful weapons and military forces to be used in defence or to attack other nations if this supports the national interests. In the lead-up to World War I all of the Great Powers of Europe were involved in increasing the strength of their armies and navies. This 'arms race', as it became known, greatly increased tensions between the nations of Europe.

#### Alliances

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfBZzy0wvzxhNGvSL9uHZ8RREThk9D1jqeYS55aNBWAFhAUCaZ8O9LOOBcBLUZVW-zi0Ru6sd6h7xhfQPoH-mBA9hrLcGDCnw2FurjPX9z2bYzj8ZdMaan6ZM679QP46n1QifFZsA?key=W30t-2KSZySPiW3RRK04rOxl)

Alliances are economic or military agreements made between two or more nations. In the lead-up to World War I the Great Powers of Europe came to form two very powerful alliances which became extremely hostile towards each other. The Triple Alliance of 1882 saw Germany, Austria and Italy sign an alliance in which all three nations agreed to support each other in time of war. The Triple Entente of 1907 saw France, Russia and Great Britain form a defensive pact aimed solely against the power of the Triple Alliance. The effect of these two alliances was to increase tensions between the Great Powers and to split Europe into two divided camps, each fearing the power of the other.

#### Nationalism

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf1ktyKiJU4raJ69QF3XPxTgOasJcuAk7bIo7WWyhbnLhOuuNYqSpc0qtX0AfTg-kgtf-vggkl2iKqse54WXuqv-wJh5B0lotlYtuaNGiXGJlXHlOTKbqnnfbT49pw36DGxQdO0oQ?key=W30t-2KSZySPiW3RRK04rOxl)

Nationalism is a strong loyalty for your own country and the belief that its needs are more important than those of other countries. By the beginning of the twentieth century, European nationalism had become aggressive. Nations turned against each other as they strived to become more powerful and important than the countries around them. 

#### Imperialism

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeSlltkVfiP2ZjfqJj7h8HyUpdt8294QDDuchLzjlGA0hAy-BITHNriZ4J0_em4WIKSnn84uuJ0HrJdFwBrZU6G5uHsHo5mZPoqAzGQGdUSHiFjw9VOYOnelj2yrWJXSnhOm0va?key=W30t-2KSZySPiW3RRK04rOxl)

Imperialism saw the nations of Europe compete with each other to establish large empires. The countries which made up these empires, known as colonies, provided raw materials, land for expansion, markets for manufactured goods, and military and trading bases for the European powers that controlled them. In times of war, colonies were expected to help fight for their colonial powers. This helped make the 1914-18 conflict a 'world' war.

Individually, any of these four long-term factors could have led to war. Together they combined to produce heightened tensions, fears and suspicions between the Great Powers. Because of these factors a 'war climate' developed where people began to believe that war was inevitable and that it was even something to be desired.

#### Who Were the Great Powers?

In the years leading up to World War I, the Great Powers of Europe were Britain, France, Russia, Germany, Austria, Italy and the Turkish Ottoman Empire.

## Australia’s Involvement in WWI

As Britain readied itself to declare war on Germany in August 1914, future Australian Prime Minister Andrew Fisher promised that 'Australia will stand behind our Mother Country to help and defend her to our last man and our last shilling'. Great Britain's war became Australia's war too. Fisher's comment reflected the attitudes of many Australians, who assumed Britain's war to be a just and noble cause in which Australians could demonstrate their loyalty to the 'mother country'. Like people of all nations, they believed that the war would be short, with the victorious troops home by Christmas, recounting tales of their glorious exploits.

### Enthusiasm for War

Pro-British war fever was the dominant emotion in most Australian cities following Britain's declaration of war on Germany on 4 August 1914. Newspapers, competing with one another to demonstrate their loyalty to the mother country, forecast countless heroic deeds against the hated enemy. This enthusiasm was especially significant because the Defence Act 1903 (Cwlth) limited the Australian Army to service in defence of Australia and only on Australian territory. Australia needed to attract volunteers to serve in an army outside Australia. This restriction did not apply to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), which participated in war under the command of Britain's Royal Navy.

Recruitment began on 10 August 1914. Within days, 40 000 men had volunteered. This was double the number the government had offered to send to Britain. By November, the first group of volunteers, including a large group of the Light Horse, had left for training in Egypt. By December 1914, 52 000 men had volunteered to serve in the army, to be known as the Australian Imperial Force (the AIF), which, when combined with New Zealanders, would form the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (the Anzacs). Three thousand men served with the Australian Flying Corps (AFC). With troops off to the battlefront, the Australian government reinforced its commitment to compulsory military training for all males between the ages of 12 and 25.

Initially, with plenty of volunteers, the Army could set high physical standards. Many men who would normally have been considered fit and healthy failed to meet those standards and were turned away. In 1914, the minimum height for acceptance into the AIF was 168 centimetres. By late 1914, recruitment officials had reduced this to 163 centimetres and by 1917 to 152 centimetres.

### Why Australians Enlisted

Support for the 'mother' country was not the only reason for Australian men's rush to enlist. 

**Other reasons included:**
- fear that the opportunity for 'adventure' would pass them by if they did not enlist quickly
- the desire to avoid the disapproval of peers and young women. Some women showed their disapproval of men who were not in uniform by giving them a white feather, a symbol of cowardice.
- the chance to earn higher wages (six shillings a day compared to one shilling a day for British soldiers)
- men's feeling that it was their ' duty' to enlist
- hatred of the 'Hun' (insulting name for Germans).

## The Schlieffen Plan

Increased tensions among the major powers led them to prepare strategies to be used if war broke out. Germany developed, and continued to update, a plan known as the Schlieffen Plan; France developed the war plan known as Plan 17.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdOsGmbZTOWekIQMYNVn4H_gY0uI4ru7ybhnhJLre6D9Wa9tWmkdBUyPaRSpsbujpBjcJP_RyvNJdXBonDqSviMvrnXc2Izum1CX-btXPtYreVhSJ25k9-mUEWM61i5_PyNFQXv?key=eP_kkTdacsPNuf2OUXzVAtSJ)Source 1 Map showing Plan 17 and the traditional view of the main features of the Schlieffen Plan

### Contestability: the Schlieffen Plan

In 2002, Terence Zuber’s book Inventing the Schlieffen Plan: German War Planning 1871–1914 began a huge debate among military historians about the Schlieffen Plan. Zuber based his work on documents that had become available from German archives only in the 1990s. He concluded that what historians have accepted for nearly a century as ‘the Schlieffen Plan’ never really existed. This would mean that the traditional view — that, to avoid a war of two fronts, Germany had to attack France once Russia had mobilised — was incorrect. According to Zuber, German officers invented the  Schlieffen Plan in the 1920s as a means of excusing their failed strategies. Other historians argue that the Schlieffen Plan existed and that the Germans implemented a modified version of it when war broke out. Debate continues with, as yet, no consensus.

## Where World War One Was Fought

Perhaps the most enduring image of World War I is that of soldiers in the trenches, covered in mud and blood, and surrounded by barbed wire. Such images were characteristic of the drawn-out war on the Western Front in France and Belgium, where Australian troops fought from 1916 to 1918. Although this was generally regarded as the most important theatre of war, there were many others (see Source 1):

- on the Eastern Front (also known as the Russian Front) between Germany and Russia in Eastern Europe; this continued until the Russians made a separate peace with Germany in 1917
- in northern Italy, where the Italians (who had left the Triple Alliance) fought against Austria-Hungary
- in the Middle East, where Allied forces, including the Australian Light Horse, fought against the Turks in Gallipoli, where the combined corps of Australian and New Zealand (ANZAC) troops joined with other units of the British army in a failed invasion of Turkey.

The fledgling Australian navy was also involved with British forces throughout the war, and in a famous action in November 1914, while travelling to join the war, HMAS Melbourne sank the German raider Emden near the Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean.

Stalemate on the Western Front

In 1914, the widely held view was that World War I would be a short war. However, after the initial movement of the German army, which marched through Belgium and deep into France, the war on the Western Front became a stalemate. This was primarily due to the fact that in the period 1914-18, the weapons and technology available to the armies in the form of artillery, machine guns and barbed wire gave the advantage to the defender. (It was not until World War II that this changed.) On the Western Front, the consequence was that the British and French could not drive the Germans out of France, and the Germans could not advance any further.

## The Gallipoli Campaign

### Reasons for Attacking Turkey

By Christmas of 1914 1 million soldiers had been killed, Russia had lost its supply route through the Dardanelles and was threatening to surrender.

Great Britain’s Winston Churchill believed the navy could be used to defeat Turkey and thus resupply Russia.  

His goals were;

- To knock Turkey out of the war
- Re-open the supply route to Russia
- Open a new front against Germany’s ally Austria – Hungary

The naval assault of February, March 1915 failed.  So it was decided to attempt a series of landings along the Gallipoli peninsula to take out the forts and thus allow the navy to break through to Istanbul.

### The Gallipoli Campaign

- Britain decided after the failed naval attack, to make a landing and use soldiers to attack.
- The invasion began on the 25th April 1915 (ANZAC Day). The British and French forces landed at a point in the south of the Dardanelles, while the ANZACs landed at a point further north. The job of the ANZACs was to stop the expected retreat of the Turks.
- Unfortunately, the ANZACs decided to “dig-in” rather than continue to advance into Turkish territory. This gave Turkey plenty of time to organise a defence.
- As a result, the Gallipoli campaign became a trench war, with neither side gaining any advantage.

### Conditions in the Trenches

By the middle of 1915, the weather had become hot and there were plagues of disease-carrying flies and fleas. Supply ships brought in water from Egypt but there was never enough.

By October, the weather had turned to bitter cold, mud and ice. Troops who arrived in peak physical condition soon suffered from illnesses such as diarrhoea, dysentery and gastroenteritis. Toilets were open pits.

Turkish soldiers, as close as 30 metres in some places, kept the ANZACs under constant fire. Consequently, corpses lay rotting in no-man’s land and wounded men lay for hours awaiting medical attention.

### Lone Pine and the Nek

British Commander, Sir Ian Hamilton, tried to break the deadlock at Gallipoli by attacking Turkish strongholds at Lone Pine and the Nek. The intention was to draw attention away from the British troops landing further south, at Suvla Bay and allied attacks at Sari Bair.

LONE PINE

- Australian troops emerged from secret tunnels close to the Turkish line.
- Australian troops were gunned down as they charged the Turkish trenches.
- Despite the odds, the ANZACs succeeded in taking Lone Pine but at a huge cost.

The NEK

- Hundreds of men from the 3rd Light Horse “went over the top” of their trenches in four suicidal charges against the Turks, only 27 metres away.
- The bombardment that was supposed to clear the trenches largely overshot its target and there was a seven minute gap between the end of the bombardment and the charge, giving the Turks both warning and time to prepare.
- Communication was disrupted, so a fourth wave left the trenches when they didn’t need to.
- This attack was a failure. 234 men died in 45 minutes.

### Evacuation of Gallipoli

- Campaign leader, Sir Ian Hamilton gave optimistic reports to the British Government despite strategists beginning to realise that they had little chance of beating the Turks at Gallipoli.
- Journalist Keith Murdoch smuggled a letter reporting the true situation to the British Prime Minister.
- Hamilton was replaced by General Sir Charles Munro who advised evacuation.
- They began evacuation in early December.
- They devised a number of tricks to hide the withdrawal:
	- Australian troops remained quiet for long periods of time.  When the Turks appeared to find out what was happening they opened fire. 
	- They organised a method whereby water dripped into a pan attached to a trigger enabled a gun to fire by itself.
- By 19th December the evacuation was complete, with only 2 casualties.  By this time, there were 26,000 casualties among the ANZAC troops, including 10,000 deaths.

## Gallipoli Strategy and Conditions

### The British Plan to Break the Stalemate

By Christmas 1914, one million Allied soldiers had died on the Western Front. The British government had begun searching for a way to break the stalemate. This meant relieving Turkish pressure on Russia, who, having lost access to its supply route through the Dardanelles, was threatening to surrender. If that happened, Germany would be able to transfer its troops from the Eastern to the Western Front and possibly defeat the Allies.

Winston Churchill, the civilian head of the British Navy, believed the Allies could win the war by using warships to attack and defeat Germany’s new ally, Turkey. The goals were to:

- force Turkey out of the war
- re-open the supply route to Russia
- open up a new front from which to attack Germany’s other main ally, Austria–Hungary
- move on to defeat Germany on the Western Front.

Source 2 (previous page) Map showing the proposed route of the naval campaign in the Dardanelles and the benefits the Allies hoped to gain from it.

The first plan was to move British and French battleships through the Dardanelles and capture Turkey’s capital at that time, Istanbul (which Westerners called Constantinople). The naval assaults in February and March 1915 failed as mines and shellfire inflicted severe damage on British and French ships. British military authorities then decided to instead attempt a series of land invasions at various points along the Gallipoli Peninsula. The attackers would comprise British, Anzac and French troops. They would use infantry (ground troops) to destroy the forts and mobile artillery that protected the Dardanelles Strait and threatened the British and French fleets.

### Gallipoli: the Nature of Warfare

#### The Landing

The invasion began on 25 April 1915 with British and French forces landing at beaches S, V, W, X and Y around Cape Helles and also on the opposite shore of the Dardanelles. The Anzacs were to land at Gaba Tepe and Ari Burnu and prevent Turkish troops retreating from the south and Turkish reinforcements arriving from the north.

The campaign began badly because:

- the failed naval bombardment had alerted the Turks to the likelihood of a land attack
- the Turks then had six weeks’ advance warning to prepare their defences
- by the time British and Anzac troops landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula, the Turks, under German General Liman von Sanders, had organised reinforcements, strengthened defences, laid mines, constructed trenches and established themselves on the high ground around both sides of the Gallipoli Peninsula and further inland
- Allied leaders missed opportunities and underestimated the Turks’ military capabilities and determination.

#### Contestability: Myth and Reality at Anzac Cove

At 4.30 am on 25 April 1915, 16 000 Anzac troops began landing under cover of darkness at a tiny beach, later known as Anzac Cove. They were two kilometres north of the original intended position at Gaba Tepe.

Australian letters and diary entries from the time, and secondary accounts in the nearly 100 years since, record troops leaving their landing craft to face an unrelenting barrage of Turkish machine-gun fire. They describe Turkish forces at both ends of the beach and at the top of its steep cliffs ready and waiting to gun down the invaders. The increased availability of Turkish sources (such as messages, signals and military reports) in the last few years is providing information that supports a different version of events. In particular, Turkish sources indicate that it was unlikely that Turkish troops were either expecting invaders to land at Anzac Cove or that, at the time of the landing, they were retaliating with machine guns:

- Turkish forces were deployed in small numbers at posts along the 60-kilometre coastline of the Gallipoli Peninsula. Their role was to report landings and delay invaders as long as possible. Reserves waited in central locations inland, ready to move once the landing spots were known, but could not arrive until some hours later. 
- There were only somewhere between 90 and 250 Turkish troops at the cove itself.
- There was a severe shortage of machine guns throughout the Turkish army.
- It was only when reinforcements arrived, around 7.30–8.30 am, that the Turks began using machine guns against their Anzac enemies.

No Australian accounts mention anyone seeing a Turkish machine gun, and there are no records of Australian troops capturing any when they gained higher ground later in the day. Some military historians believe that Australian casualties would have been much higher had the Turks been using machine guns early in the day.

Historians have come up with a number of hypotheses to explain why Australians might have incorrectly recorded being under enemy machine-gun fire:

- Some may have purposely tried to increase the sense of danger and threat that they encountered in their first experience of enemy fire.
- Some may have repeated rumours that what they heard was machine-gun fire.
- Even experienced soldiers cannot always tell the difference between heavy and rapid rifle fire and machine-gun fire.
- Any machine guns they did actually hear may have been their own.

As this example shows, Turkish sources have already led historians to question traditional accounts of the Gallipoli landing. Increased efforts to access and translate more of these in the lead-up to the 2015 Gallipoli centenary should open up more areas of debate and lead to a greater depth of understanding of all aspects of the Gallipoli campaign.

#### April–August 1915

The Anzacs initially began to head for the cliffs and their first-day objectives — Hill 971, the Third Ridge and MalTepe Hill. Possibly as early as 6 am, Australian commanders ordered the Second Brigade to abandon this offensive and instead to provide support for troops on the right flank, who were supposedly under threat from Turkish reinforcements. Troops then began to dig in at the Second Ridge.

As more and more Turkish reserves arrived, the Anzacs lost the opportunity that had existed for them to make significant advances into Turkish territory in the first three or four hours after their arrival. By digging in instead of continuing to advance against the vastly outnumbered Turks, the Anzacs ended up on the defensive. By nightfall of the first day, the Anzacs had failed to reach their first-day objectives.

They had advanced only about 900 metres at a cost of about 2000 casualties, including 621 dead. Over the next week, another 27 000 soldiers landed at Anzac Cove, where they tried to maintain control of the beach and construct trenches — all under the constant barrage of Turkish fire from distances as close as 30 metres and with little chance of regaining the initiative lost on the first day.

Soldiers armed with entrenching tools and sandbags hastily constructed the trenches and dugouts that would provide them with some protection. The task was difficult because the men mainly had to lie on their stomachs, using the entrenching tool without its handle.

Standing up to dig normally would have made them easy targets for the Turks. Over the following weeks, dugouts appeared all over the hillsides above Anzac Cove.

These were the places where the Anzacs ate, slept, wrote letters home, darned holes in their socks, smoked cigarettes and waited until they were called to active duty.

#### May 1915

On 19 May 1915, 42 000 Turks advanced in an attempt to break through Anzac lines. They were unsuccessful and both sides paid a huge toll in the number of dead and wounded. The Turks and the Anzacs agreed to stop fighting for a few hours so they could bury their dead and collect the wounded from no-man’s land.

Source 5 An extract from Gallipoli: the Turkish story by Kevin Fewster, Vecihi Basarin and Hatice HÜrmÜz Basarin

After a month of continual fighting and ceaseless noise, the sudden tranquillity seemed unreal … It was a welcome chance to stretch without fear of being shot. For the first time in many weeks, men could stand and survey the whole landscape. It was also a unique opportunity to meet the enemy. Men stepped up to the ceasefire line and swapped smiles, photographs, cigarettes and small gifts with each other. An Australian ambulance officer found the Ottomans ‘peaceful-looking men, stolid in type and of the peasant class mostly. We fraternised with them and gave them cigarettes and tobacco …’.

Shallow graves were excavated and the dead were buried where they lay. Mercifully, the day was cool, but it was a vile task nonetheless … [An] Australian felt eternally grateful to the

Ottoman medico who gave him pieces of scented wool to block his nostrils. Before the day was through, some four thousand bodies had been buried. At 4.30 pm, as arranged, the men climbed back down into their trenches … At 4.45 pm, a single shot rang out. Soon, the chatter of rifle fire returned to its normal level.

In June and July 1915, the main fighting involved British attacks — for limited gains — and Turkish counter attacks in the Cape Helles area. Both sides suffered the high casualties that were a feature of trench warfare.

#### Living Conditions

Conditions at Gallipoli tested everyone’s endurance. By mid-year, the weather had become hot and there were plagues of disease-carrying flies and fleas. Supply ships brought in water from Egypt, but there was never enough. By October, soldiers were beginning to experience the bitter cold, mud and ice that were characteristic of a Turkish winter.

Source 7 An extract from the writings of author Ion Idriess, describing life at Gallipoli

I wrapped my overcoat over the tin and gouged out the flies, then spread the biscuit, held my hand over it and drew the biscuit out of the coat. But a lot of flies flew into my mouth and beat about inside. I nearly howled with rage.

Quoted in B. Gammage, The Broken Years: Australian Soldiers in the Great War, ANU, Canberra, 1974.

Troops who had arrived in peak physical condition soon suffered dysentery, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis and infestations of lice. It was virtually impossible to keep clean. Toilets were open pits. Corpses lay rotting in no-man’s land between the opposing trenches because it was unsafe to try to retrieve them for burial. Wounded men lay for hours awaiting medical attention. During some weeks in the Gallipoli campaign, as many as 20 per cent of the men were sick from diseases relating to poor hygiene.

Turkish soldiers, as close as 30 metres in some places, kept the Anzacs under constant threat with hand grenades, sniper fire, mortar bombs and shell blasts. The casualty rate was generally 23 per cent. It was difficult to escape either physically or psychologically from the war.

## Gallipoli Battles and Outcome

### August 1915: Lone Pine and the Nek

#### Lone Pine

In August, the British, under regional commander Sir Ian Hamilton, decided to try a new tactic to break the deadlock. Anzac troops were to attack the Turkish strongholds at Lone Pine and the Nek in the hope of distracting attention from Allied troops landing at Suvla Bay and Allied attacks at Sari Bair. The aim was for them to gain control of Sari Bair and link the Anzac front with Suvla Bay.

At Lone Pine, the Australians surprised the Turks by emerging from underground tunnels that extended to about half-way between their own lines and the Turkish lines. However, they became easy targets for Turkish gunfire until they found a way into the Turkish trenches, which were covered with logs and earth. The Anzacs succeeded in taking Lone Pine but at a huge cost to both sides. Over four days of bitter hand-to-hand fighting, from 6 August to 10 August, the Anzacs suffered 2300 casualties and the Turks suffered 6000. Seven Australians gained Victoria Crosses as a result of this action.

#### The Nek

The attack at the Nek was even worse. In the early hours of 7 August 1915, hundreds of men from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade went ‘over the top’ of their trenches in four virtually suicidal charges against the Turkish trenches at ‘Baby 700’, only 27 metres away. The attack failed for a number of reasons:

- New Zealand troops were meant to attack at the same time from Chunuk Bair, which leaders believed they could capture the night before. This would mean they would be attacking from the rear of Turkish troops at Baby 700. However, it was 8 August, 24 hours later, before the New Zealanders even got to Chunuk Bair.
- Allied artillery shells from a preliminary bombardment overshot their targets.
- A seven-minute gap between the end of the artillery bombardment and the beginning of the infantry attack meant that the Turks had both warning of what was to come and enough time to prepare for it.

With the New Zealanders unable to attack from behind Turkish lines, there was no reason to begin what would become a frontal attack on heavily defended Turkish positions. Not having received any counter-instructions, the first and second waves of the Light Horse went ‘over the top’ and faced relentless machine-gun and rifle fire from the Turkish trenches.

Major Antill, second in charge of the Brigade, was convinced that some Australians had reached the Turkish trenches. He insisted, despite protests from another of the Light Horse commanders, that a third wave go over the top as well. This had better results only because the soldiers knew to hit the ground as quickly as possible. Colonel Hughes, commander in charge of the 3rd Light Horse, then cancelled the attack. This was too late for the fourth wave, who had already left their trenches. In a 45 minute period, there were 372 casualties among the Light Horse, of whom 234 died.

|   |
|---|
|The most tragic feint attack, at once the most gallant and the most hopeless, was made by the 8th and 10th Light Horse Regiments against the Turkish trenches at The Nek. The Nek was a ridge 50 yards wide at the Anzac line, narrowing to about 30 at the Turkish front. The opposing trenches on it were about 20 yards apart, and at least five Turkish machine guns covered the intervening ground. Four lines of the light horse, each of about 150 men, were to seize the enemy front line and the maze of trenches and saps behind it, on Baby 700. They would be preceded by a naval and artillery bombardment, and were to attack at two minute intervals. The light horsemen were eager and confident, for this was their first great battle, and they expected to break from the interminable trenches into the open.<br><br>  <br><br>Sick men hid or escaped from their doctors to be in the charge . . .<br><br>  <br><br>At four in the afternoon of 6 August the artillery began a gentle bombardment. It intensified early on the 7th, but at four twenty three a.m., seven minutes before time, it ceased . . . In the enemy trenches soldiers cautiously emerged from shelter, lined their front two deep, fired short bursts to clear their machine guns, levelled their rifles, and waited. At four thirty precisely the first line of the 8th Light Horse leapt from their trenches. As their helmets appeared above the parapet, an awful fire broke upon them.<br><br>  <br><br>Many were shot, but a line started forward. It crumpled and vanished within five yards . . . The second line saw the fate of their friends.<br><br>  <br><br>Over their heads the Turk fire thundered undiminished, drowning out any verbal order . . . Beside them lay dead and wounded of the first line, hit before they cleared the trench. But they waited two minutes as ordered, then sprang forward. They were shot down. The 10th Light Horse filed into the vacant places in the trench.<br><br>  <br><br>They could hardly have doubted their fate . . . and they determined to die bravely, by running swiftly at the enemy. ‘Boys, you have ten minutes to live,’ their commanding officer told them, ‘and I am going to lead you.’ Men shook hands with their mates, took position, and when the order came, charged into the open. The bullets . . . tumbled them into the dust beside their comrades.<br><br>  <br><br>Moves were made to halt the fourth line, but too late, and these men, too, climbed out to be killed. It was now a little after five fifteen a.m. Two hundred and thirty-four dead light horsemen lay in an area little larger than a tennis court . . . One hundred and thirty-eight others were wounded . . . ‘It was heroic,’ wrote one who watched them, ‘it was marvellous . . . yet it was murder.’<br><br>Bill Gammage, The Broken Years, ANU, Canberra, 1974, pp. 73–5.|

### The Outcome

By late August 1915, some British military strategists were beginning to think that they had little chance of defeating Turkish troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula. At the same time, campaign leader Sir Ian Hamilton’s largely optimistic reports failed to indicate just how bad the situation was. This changed when Australian journalist Keith Murdoch arrived in London from Gallipoli in mid September.

Murdoch smuggled out a letter that English journalist Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett had written to inform the British Prime Minister, H.H. Asquith, of his concerns about the campaign and especially about Hamilton’s performance. When military officials confiscated Ashmead-Bartlett’s letter, Murdoch recorded his own version of it. Asquith and his ministers read this account, accepted it unquestioningly and in mid October dismissed Hamilton. The new commander, General Sir Charles Munro, advised evacuation rather than continue with what he predicted would be a 30–40 per cent casualty rate.

Allied troops began withdrawing from Anzac Cove and Suvla Bay in early December 1915. They devised a number of tricks to try to camouflage their withdrawal:

- Australian troops kept silent for long periods of time and then, when the Turks appeared to find out what was happening, they opened fire.
- They also organised a method whereby water dripped into a pan attached to a trigger would make a rifle fire itself.

By 19 December, the evacuation was complete, with only two casualties. By this time, there were 26 000 casualties among the Anzac troops, including about 10 000 deaths.

## The Western Front

After the Gallipoli campaign, the Australian infantry divisions went on to fight some of the worst battles of the war. Between 1916 and late 1918, 295 000 Australian soldiers served on the Western Front. The Battle of the Somme in France in 1916 and the Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium in 1917 are the two battles that most represent the needless slaughter of young Australian men on the World War I battlefields.

### 1916: The Somme

The Battle of the Somme (July to November 1916) was another doomed attempt at breaking the stalemate on the Western Front. The plan was to launch a major attack on German lines in the Somme River valley. The assault would begin with an intense artillery bombardment of German defences.

Then, 1.2 million soldiers would advance in wave formations along a 40-kilometre front. The aim was to cut the Germans off from behind and make them so demoralised that they would surrender.

The Germans had weeks of forewarning through:

- overheard field telephone messages
- the movements of British reconnaissance aircraft
- the observations of their own pilots.

When the attack began on 1 July 1916:

- German defences were well prepared
- British mines went off too early and alerted the Germans that the attack was due to start
- British artillery fire failed to destroy the barbed wire protecting the German trenches.

When the soldiers advanced into no-man’s land, they advanced into a non-stop barrage of German machine-gun fire. They became easy targets as their attempts to pass through the German barbed wire only made them become more entangled in it. The Allied troops did not have the machine-gun power needed to respond effectively. On the first day, the Germans killed over 20 000 Allied troops and wounded 40 000.

The attack failed to achieve a large-scale breakthrough, and tactics focused instead on raids on specific enemy targets such as those at Fromelles and Pozières.

### Fromelles (Pronounced ‘From-ell’)

Australian soldiers’ first battle on the Western Front was the ill-fated Battle of Fromelles on 19–20 July 1916. Their goal was to divert German attention from the main action to the south and prevent them sending reinforcements there. Planning was rushed, the soldiers lacked experience and the distance across no-man’s land was as much as 400 metres in some sections. After seven hours of Allied artillery fire, German machine gunners, with the added advantage of being on higher ground, were well and truly ready when British and Australian troops began their attack in the evening of 19 July. By the early hours of 20 July, the 5th Australian Division had 5533 casualties and one of the greatest losses of Australian lives ever within a 24-hour period.![|443x432](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcRBA3v7_XbEdfQr7BeyXpcyoBFvpwEd6oLo9HwcxMUKKaTzllGOo0LXi6X5n1pzmZ-vYaPt2RfcokPT5fryHLgrYDwugSTCeALwbXu6Jp0p_kLl8JDu-lz5OaaWWLa9xv_Pq3z?key=FEn95qkq-7eGZuetfIoQeRPu)

### Pozières (Pronounced “Pozzie-air’)

A few days later, the First Australian Division had the task of capturing the German-held town of Pozières. This was achieved in a few hours on 23 July 1916, but it took another

seven weeks of horrific fighting against ongoing German artillery fire to consolidate the gain. By this time, three more Australian divisions had become involved.

In July 1916, there were 90 000 AIF soldiers serving on the Western Front. By the end of August 1916, there were 23 000 Australian casualties from the Somme battlefields — nearly as many as for the entire eight months at Gallipoli. By the end of the Somme campaign, the AIF had lost more than 32 000 soldiers, with an overall gain in land of about 10.5 kilometres. Neither the average Australian soldier nor the average British soldier had much faith in their military leaders after this.

### 1917: Passchendaele (Pronounced ‘Pashendarl’)

From mid to late 1917, two Anzac divisions took part in fighting in and around Ieper (Ypres) in Belgium. This was the third battle of Ieper, also known as the Battle of Passchendaele. The battle was part of a British attempt to break through the German lines towards the North Sea ports, where the German U-boats were berthed. There were 7000 Australian casualties during the initial attack in June.

In July 1917, the British resumed artillery shelling of German defences. The Germans had the advantage of higher ground and a wide view of their attackers’ movements. Over the next fourteen weeks, Allied troops made ten attempts to break through to Passchendaele. Men and equipment became bogged down in mud and flooded fields. General Haig insisted that the attack proceed. When his chief of staff visited the battlefield, he reportedly had tears in his eyes as he said, ‘Good God, did we really send men to fight in that?’ Overall, the Allied forces suffered 300 000 casualties; 38 000 were Australian.

## WWI Trenches

### Trench Warfare: Digging in

The main fighting in World War I took place on the Western Front. The battleground stretched from the Belgian coast in the north to the Swiss Alps in the south and was marked out by lines of trenches. Seldom more than one metre wide and perhaps two metres deep, these trenches were home to millions of troops. Over four long years both sides' armies lived, ate, slept, fought and died amidst the horror that was trench warfare.

Most battlefield trench lines were made up of a number of defensive structures. The most common arrangement was the three-line trench system. This allowed front-line trenches for firing at the enemy, reserve trenches to hold reinforcements ready to join the fighting and support trenches where troops could be rested. The trenches were dug in zig-zag patterns so that the blast from an exploding artillery shell was isolated to a small area, protecting men further down the trench line. This zig-zagging also helped if the trench lines were overrun by the enemy, slowing their advance. Communication trenches linked all three trench lines, allowing for the movement of troops and information.

As the war progressed many trenches were expanded and became almost permanent homes for the troops. Some German trenches extended up to ten metres underground.

1918: Towards Victory

Following Russian surrender in late 1917, Germany transferred more divisions to the Western Front. In anticipation of the arrival of US troops to fight on the Allied side, Germany launched a Spring Offensive in the Somme. After initial success, war-weary and poorly supplied German forces, facing sustained and well-coordinated Allied defence, failed to achieve a breakthrough.

4 July: the Battle of Hamel

1918 provided opportunities for new Allied commanders to use tactics and strategies that would make the most effective use of new technology. The Battle of Hamel on 4 July 1918 was the forerunner of the model for Allied attacks for the duration of the war. In 93 minutes the Anzacs, under the command of Lieutenant General John Monash, achieved their objective of capturing the town of Hamel. This was a key goal in facilitating the defence of Amiens and launching a counter-offensive against the Germans.

The success showed the benefits of Monash’s meticulous planning: allowing time for his orders to be circulated and fully understood, camouflaging his intentions with skilful use of diversionary tactics, and starting the operation under cover of darkness. Most importantly, he successfully coordinated the infantry with every form of weaponry and technology available — artillery and machine gun barrages, wireless, tanks and aeroplanes, with the latter two used for the transport of heavy weaponry as well as in combat. The attack conserved the energy of his troops and minimised their vulnerability to the enemy having advance notice of their plans.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc4aO2G6F_284UqIHO4JcAe5VNVCUvqFnKliKpff5vCJ5y2V30AJvjZroFuAs2LYdBJtoGls8QHL8NhZOA8l4c0jm05506YZSz-X00CP3-vjndb4kTP__uL1wYM9F2ALjN6hkz7VQ?key=WGqXbbfR4TYUaS2obZNRIQ)

The 100 days

On 8 August 1918, British, Canadian and Australian soldiers launched a massive offensive resulting in what German General Erich Ludendorff called der schwarze Tag — ‘the black day’ of the German army. Over the next 100 days, Allied forces relentlessly attacked German forces and, by early October, had broken through the entire depth of the defence system the Germans called the Hindenburg Line. With its army in retreat and its soldiers’ morale low, the German High Command asked the German government to obtain an armistice.

The armistice and ceasefire that ended the war came into effect at 11 am on 11 November 1918 — over four years after the war had started.

## Understanding Propaganda

Propaganda is information, ideas or argument used to further a cause or damage an opponent’s cause. Its purpose is to influence the audience to adopt a certain attitude or take a certain action.

Propaganda expresses information that supports a particular point of view — often a political idea — and does this in a way that will encourage an emotional response, rather than an objective or intellectual response.

In World War I, the Australian government used propaganda to gain and maintain support for the war and to encourage enlistment. Groups from both sides of the conscription debate used propaganda posters to influence people’s vote. Posters were a common means of spreading propaganda.

Techniques included:

- portraying the enemy as barbaric, non-human and incapable of justice or compassion, often through the use of stereotyping to make everything about the enemy unacceptable
- giving people a direct order, such as ‘Join Up today!’, so that people felt that someone in authority was telling them what to do
- appealing to feelings of nationalism and patriotism
- suggesting negative/unacceptable ideas in which opponents supposedly believed
- simplifying an idea to make it attractive or acceptable
- projecting a positive image and suggesting that the target audience can acquire this image by following the order the poster provides
- choosing words and phrases that convey positive concepts, such as ‘support’.

## The Changing Role of Women

Australian women did not have military and economic equality with men. Australia did not need women to replace men in the paid workforce as desperately as did countries like Germany and Britain. While women in those countries took on ‘men’s work’, Australian women’s main wartime work was in volunteer work and in poorly paid traditionally ‘female’ roles. The Australian government refused women roles that many would have liked as members of auxiliary units attached to the armed forces. Some women worked in non-fighting roles providing medical services near the war front.

### Voluntary Work

Lady Helen Munro-Ferguson, wife of the Governor-General, helped form the Australian Branch of the British Red Cross Society. She became its first president. The organisation’s patriotic focus and links with the social elite attracted many middle-class women, and significant donations from groups such as the Australian Jockey Club. Women attended working bees where, over the period of the war, they produced thousands of items of clothing for the soldiers abroad. The Red Cross also sent food parcels to Australian prisoners of war and provided assistance to families by establishing a Wounded and Missing Inquiry Bureau.

The Australian Comforts Fund (ACF) was the other key organisation for volunteer work. Women officially established it in 1916 by joining together similar organisations from each state. The ACF provided ‘comfort boxes’, which contained the ‘luxury’ food, clothing or other items that went beyond the basics supplied by the AIF. These included such things as:

- cakes and puddings
- biscuits, condensed milk and sugar
- cigarettes, tobacco and matches
- chewing gum
- Handkerchiefs
- writing materials
- Newspapers
- extra clothing
- messages of support.

In keeping with its motto, ‘Keep the Fit man Fit’ the ACF helped prevent trench foot by ensuring that soldiers, who had no washing facilities in the trenches, had an adequate supply of dry socks. Every few weeks, organisers sent 10 000 pairs of hand-knitted socks to the men overseas — each pair representing about ten hours of labour. By late 1918, Australian women had knitted 1 354 328 pairs of socks for the ACF.

Other important voluntary organisations were Sydney’s Soldiers’ Sock Fund, which sent 21 000 pairs of socks overseas each year and Adelaide’s Cheer-Up society, which helped organise food, concerts and gifts for soldiers.

Women’s voluntary work also supported the shipping costs of these organisations. They raised funds by making and selling cakes, running button days, fetes and street stalls, and by organising and participating in door-knock appeals. Voluntary work enabled some middle class women to develop skills in fundraising, organisation, management, and collection and distribution that they might not have gained otherwise.

### The AWSC

In late 1916, hundreds of women joined the newly-formed Australian Women’s Service Corps (AWSC). They wanted to prepare for a more active war role — performing noncombatant tasks at the battle front as ambulance drivers, cooks or hospital orderlies. They wanted work that would release the ‘able-bodied men who are now performing these duties’ for active military service. The AWSC also conducted basic military training for its members. The Defence Department refused to take these women seriously.

### The Paid Workforce

Women’s participation in the paid workforce rose from 24 per cent in 1914 to 37 per cent in 1918. Women found their war work largely restricted to traditionally ‘female’ areas of work in the food, clothing, footwear, printing and textile industries. They also continued to work as shop assistants, in office work, in teaching and as nurses.

The factory was well ventilated and well lit and this, along with the latest machinery, made it a ‘model’ for modern production methods.

Whenever women replaced men in the workplace, it was only as part of a ‘reserve’ labour force. This meant that people believed women had a short-term place in the workforce rather than a long-term right to a position there. Some women took temporary jobs in the police force, in farming, in factories and in small businesses. Clerical work was popular, with about 10 000 women undertaking this form of employment during the war. Unions feared that if women did ‘men’s work’ at female pay rates, they would threaten men’s jobs or force men to accept lower wages. Society expected that when the war ended, soldiers would return to their homes, their families and ‘their’ jobs.

Cartoon titled ‘That Promise’ from The Worker 10 February 1916

Women’s pre-war wages were usually about half of what men were paid for doing the same work. This was decided in the 1907 Harvester Case, in which Justice Higgins established the principle of a basic wage that would enable a man to support a wife and three children. Women’s wages were to be a percentage of this amount. In the Rural Workers’ Case in 1912, Justice Higgins refused women the right to equal pay for equal work because they ‘did not have to feed a family’.

He assumed that all ‘breadwinners’ were men and that all females would have a man to support them. World War I showed the reality to be different, with some men enlisting to escape unwelcome family responsibilities. The government responded by ensuring soldiers allocated part of their pay to wives and children at home.

### Women’s Recruitment Role

Australia needed to attract volunteers to serve in an army outside Australia as the law restricted the regular army to service on Australian soil. The government expected women to show their patriotism by putting pressure on men to enlist. It created posters depicting women as potentially helpless and passive victims of unrestricted German aggression, and enlistment as the only means of protecting them. In the conscription campaigns of 1916 and 1917, women launched appeals for both the ‘yes’ and the ‘no’ vote.

He had gone to the Great War of 1914–1918 and did not return. They had no children. She had never remarried. She lived in the same house, alone, for more than 60 years.|

### Grief and Worry

Women on the home front were part of a community for whom sad news was an ever present threat. Many had a husband, brother, son or friend serving overseas. In a world without television or the internet, most had no mental image of the places where their loved ones battled, the conditions they endured or the cemeteries where they were buried.

Some women could balance the news of a loved one’s death with the thought that it had been for ‘a noble cause’. At the same time, they had to re-make their lives with the knowledge that someone they cared for would not return.

This was a personal and individual hardship that the nation could not share. As war continued and numbers of casualties on the Western Front multiplied, some women became more cynical and more questioning when faced with government and community expectations that they continue to express patriotic enthusiasm for war.

## The Conscription Debate

Australia’s involvement in World War I

### Conscription

Conscription meant forcing able bodied men of military age to fight in the war. This means that the government could randomly select men of the appropriate age and make them go to war. If the men refused to go, they would be breaking the law.

The Conscription Debate was very divisive. This was especially because the war was being fought overseas and Australia was not directly threatened. Was it acceptable to force people to fight for wars in other countries?

## Conscription in Australia

As the news came from Gallipoli that more troops were needed on the Front, the call for recruits was sent out across the Empire.

Britain passed laws to introduce conscription in January 1916. Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes wanted to follow suit and held the first referendum to poll the Australian population in October 1916. The voting was close and a NO vote was passed. A massive recruitment drive was launched across the Empire; however, supply could not meet demand as huge losses were experienced in the trenches and on the battlefields of Somme and Ypres. 

A second referendum was held in December 1917 and this time, a resounding NO came from the Australian public. Many attributed this change in public opinion to the climbing death toll on the battlefields.

As a result of two failed referendums, Conscription was not introduced in Australia during the Great War.

### Propaganda Techniques

Propaganda means deliberately presenting a one sided story, usually through news items, books or posters.

Both sides of the conscription debate exaggerated their case by playing on peoples’ emotions such as:  Guilt, Duty, Hatred, Loyalty, Patriotism and particularly, Love of family.

### Creating the Anzac Legend

The Gallipoli campaign and the Anzac legend that emerged from it have had a significant impact on ideas about Australia’s national identity. Although a military defeat, reports of Australians at Gallipoli have had a profound effect on how Australians view themselves. For many people, the participation of Australian soldiers in the Gallipoli campaign symbolises Australia’s coming of age as a nation and demonstrates the qualities that characterise Australians. British war correspondent Ellis Ashmead- Bartlett (1881–1931) helped to create this legend with his newspaper report on the Gallipoli landing.

|Source 1 An extract from Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett’s newspaper article ‘Australians at Dardanelles: thrilling deeds of heroism’ reporting on Australians landing at Gallipoli. Ashmead-Bartlett ‘observed’ the landing from a battleship some distance away and did not arrive at Gallipoli until 9.30 pm on 25 April.<br><br>  <br><br>The Australians, who were about to go into action for the first time in trying circumstances, were cheerful, quiet and confident. There was no sign of nerves nor of excitement . . . the boats had almost reached the beach when a party of Turks, entrenched ashore, opened a terrible fusillade with rifles and a Maxim [machine gun] . . .<br><br>  <br><br>The Australians rose to the occasion. Not waiting for orders or for the boats to reach the beach, they sprang into the sea and, forming a sort of rough line, rushed at the enemy trenches.<br><br>Their magazines were not charged, so they just went in with cold steel. It was over in a minute. The Turks in the first trench were either bayoneted or they ran away and their Maxim was captured.<br><br>  <br><br>Then the Australians found themselves facing an almost perpendicular cliff of loose sandstone . . . Somewhere, half-way up, the enemy had a second trench, strongly held . . . Here was a tough proposition to tackle in the darkness, but those colonials, practical above all else, went about it in a practical way . . . They stopped for a few minutes . . . got rid of their packs, and charged their magazines.<br><br>  <br><br>Then this race of athletes proceeded to scale the cliffs without responding to the enemy’s fire. They lost some men, but did not worry. In less than a quarter of an hour the Turks were out of their second position, either bayoneted or fleeing . . .<br><br>  <br><br>The courage displayed by the wounded Australians will never be forgotten . . . Though many were shot to bits, without hope of recovery, their cheers resounded throughout the night . . . They were happy because they knew they had been tried for the first time and not found wanting . . . There has been no finer feat in this war than this sudden landing in the dark and storming the heights . . .<br><br>Argus, 8 May 1915.|

This was the first report on the landing that Australian newspapers published. It found an appreciative and ready audience among those who:

- were concerned about Australian soldiers’ reputation for being ‘undisciplined’, gained while they were training in Egypt
- feared that Australians might have behaved poorly in their first military engagement
- wanted to see Australian soldiers at least equal the efforts of British and Canadian troops (who had performed well in France)
- were looking for a positive national identity for Australia that was distinct from that of Great Britain
- were concerned about how people of other nationalities would judge Australia in the world arena.

Australians at home responded enthusiastically to this praise. Enlistment figures for June 1915 (12 505) were nearly double the figures for April. In July, they soared to 36 575 — nearly a 300 per cent increase on the month before.

People used extracts from Ashmead-Bartlett’s report in fund-raising brochures, theatre playbills and in a booklet that the New South Wales Department of Education distributed to schoolchildren. One film-maker used it as the basis of a 1915 film entitled The Hero of the Dardanelles (filmed at Tamarama Beach, Sydney). One woman, in a letter distributed widely among soldiers, described her feeling on reading Ashmead-Bartlett’s account as ‘pride’, ‘exultation’ and the sentiment ‘Thank God, I am an Australian’.

From this time onward, reports of what Australians were doing at Gallipoli took precedence over reports of what the British or anyone else was doing. Ashmead-Bartlett became a media celebrity and people valued and enjoyed his reports.

Ashmead-Bartlett’s article inspired the creation of a framework for interpreting events and experiences on the Gallipoli Peninsula and identifying the characteristic features of the ‘true Australian’ — heroism, mateship, initiative, a disregard for authority, athletic ability, endurance and a cheeky sense of humour. Australia’s official war correspondent, Charles Bean, reinforced this image through his own reports from Gallipoli, through his 1916 best seller, The Anzac Book — a book of soldiers’ stories, poems and artwork — and ultimately in the 12 volumes of his Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–18. Bean was conscious of doing this and careful to reject any submissions to The Anzac Book that did not fit within this formula.

### Contestability: Debating the Anzac Legend

From the late twentieth century onwards, Australian governments have again promoted the Anzac legend’s concept of Gallipoli as Australia’s ‘baptism of fire’ and the Australian soldier at Gallipoli as the personification of Australia’s national identity. Some historians believe that enthusiasm for Gallipoli and the Anzac legend is distorting the reality of our history. They feel that Anzac Day and the Anzac legend have become expressions of emotion, sentimentality and nostalgia that deny the reality of soldiers’ wartime experiences and undermine recognition of more significant events and values in Australia’s history.

In his 1992 Anzac Day address, then Prime Minister Keating declared: ‘Legends . . . define us to ourselves. But they should not stifle us . . . constrain our growth, or restrict us when we have to change’. In October 2008, he delivered a speech expressing his view that Australians should not see Gallipoli as the place where Australia was ‘born’ or ‘redeemed’ (see source 3).

Dragged into service by the imperial government in an ill conceived and poorly executed campaign, we were cut to ribbons and dispatched. And none of it in the defence of Australia. Without seeking to simplify the then bonds of empire and the implicit sense of obligation, or to diminish the bravery of our own men, we still go on as though the nation was born again or even was redeemed there. An utter and complete nonsense.<br><br>  <br><br>For these reasons I have never been to Gallipoli and I never will.|

### The ‘man with the donkey’

Private John Simpson Kirkpatrick (1892–1915) was an Englishman who had lived in Australia since 1910 after deserting his position in the merchant navy. Motivated by the hope of getting back to England, he enlisted in the AIF in August 1914 under the name ‘John Simpson’. He ended up at Anzac Cove. Simpson’s actions there were mentioned in official reports and became part of a 1916 book entitled Glorious Deeds of Australasians in the Great War. This was propaganda, which greatly exaggerated what Simpson had done and singled him out as a hero at a time when Australia needed new recruits.

Simpson served 24 days at Anzac Cove. He was meant to serve as a stretcher-bearer transporting seriously wounded men from the front lines back down to Anzac Cove. Instead, he chose to work alone, with a donkey, delivering water as he made his way up the heights above the beach, through the dangerous Shrapnel and Monash gullies to bring the wounded back down on his donkey. He and the two wounded he was transporting were shot dead in Monash Gully on 19 May 1915.

For many people, Simpson typifies the man of the Anzac legend. Others argue that he was English, a reluctant recruit and someone whose assistance to relatively few and not seriously wounded men, while noteworthy, did not make him a hero.

### Historians’ Criticisms

Historians who criticise the Anzac legend put forward the following points:

- The legend ignores the reality of Australia’s huge death toll fighting a war fought on foreign soil in the interests of Great Britain.
- Australians invaded Turkey and killed people defending their own land.
- Soldiers of all armies experienced mateship and many of the other values celebrated in the Anzac legend; these are not uniquely Australian.
- The fact that someone is heroic does not necessarily mean that they are morally right.
- World War I caused more division than nation-building in Australian society.
- At war’s end, Australia still had a British head of state and the British government still decided Australia’s foreign policy
- The Anzac legend ignores other important influences on Australia’s national identity — traditions of a ‘fair go’ and egalitarianism; support for economic, gender, racial and social equality; belief in democracy.
- Australia’s history before 1915, Federation, campaigns for social and political rights, and migration have also played significant roles in building the Australian nation.
- To say that wars are what make nations come of age is to accept the value system of the pre–World War I writers who sold a message that war was worthwhile.

|Source 5 An extract from historians Henry Reynolds’ and Marilyn Lake’s epilogue ‘Moving on’ in What’s wrong with Anzac?, 2010, page 167<br><br>  <br><br>Like many Australians who are concerned with the homage paid to the Anzac spirit and associated militarisation of our history, we are concerned with the way history is used to define our national heritage and national values. We suggest that Australians might look to alternative national traditions that gave pride of place to equality of opportunity and the pursuit of social justice: the idea of a living wage and sexual and racial equality. In the myth of Anzac, military achievements are exalted above civilian ones; events overseas are given priority over Australian developments; slow and patient nation-building is eclipsed by the bloody drama of battle; action is exalted above contemplation. The key premise of the Anzac legend is that nations and men are made at war. It is an idea that had currency a hundred years ago. Is it not now time to cast it aside?|

## The Treaty of Versailles

By the time the war ended in 1918, millions were dead, including 60000 Australians.

Germany was blamed for causing the war, and its traditional enemy, France, ensured that the peace settlement punished the Germans and made the country pay heavily for the cost of the war. The map of Europe was redrawn after World War I without the former empires of Russia, Austria-Hungary and Turkey. New countries such as Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia were created. The first communist state, the USSR, emerged from the collapse of the Russian monarchy. The end of World War I saw an international desire to create an organisation that would ensure world peace. Led by America in its new role as a world power, the League of Nations was formed.

![|406](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcPgu37iyj2R2AoE1-AwT5NDx4QMebDJZxFjSeHSYpyS13NCt_on8yffLcu-oCEmcFf6aHVFFRA3V4G_kSRD644wdbp6RA7k0xKSUMXwX0_b5KTQuE2FYtPY2DEIdYqw-W5uk9_?key=vX5qanV4Oz8BmsAYTDxgdw)

At the end of World War I, leaders of 32 Countries met at the Paris Peace Conference, which began on 12th January 1919, to discuss the Treaties to be made with each of the defeated powers. Negotiations were dominated by Britain (represented by prime minister David Lloyd George), France (represented by prime minister Georges Clemenceau), Italy (represented by prime minister Vittorio Orlando), Japan (represented by a former prime minister, Saionji Kinmochi) and the United States (represented by president Woodrow Wilson). Australia was represented by its prime minister, William (Billy) Hughes.

Division existed among these representatives on how Harshly the defeated countries should be treated. The United States wanted a fair and Just settlement, for example, whereas France (and Australia) wanted Germany to be severely Punished.

The French were to have their way. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28  June 1919, Germany was Reduced in size, lost its overseas colonies, could not have an Airforce or tanks, forbidden to unite with Austria, and had to pay reparations to the Allies for the cost of the War.

### Conditions for the Treaty of Versailles

Under the Treaty of Versailles, Germany had to:

- accept a vote to be held in northern Schleswig to settle whether the territory was part of Germany or not
- agree that Germany and Austria were never to be unified
- allow Danzig, which had been an important German port, to become a free city (the surrounding land became part of Poland)
- allow the Saarland (a resource-rich area) to come under French control
- be demilitarised and allow the Rhineland to be occupied by non-German armies for 15 years
- give Eupen-Malmedy to Belgium, Memel to Lithuania, and the Hultschin district to Czechoslovakia
- limit its army to 100 000 men and agree that Germany was not to have conscription, heavy artillery, poison gas, tanks, aircraft or airships, that its navy could not have vessels of more than 100,000 tonnes and that no submarines were allowed.
- pay war reparations of £6600 million (this is equivalent to approximately $2.6 trillion today, or more than two-and-a-half times the value of the entire Australian economy- its gross domestic product-in 2011)
- return the border region of Alsace-Lorraine to France
- surrender all of its colonies
- surrender Poznania, parts of East Prussia and Upper Silesia (on Germany's eastern border) to Poland
- take responsibility for starting the war (covered by the 'war guilt' clause)
