|Convicts|- Poverty, poor living conditions and high crime rate led to a large number of convicts.<br>    <br>- They were sold to American plantations which made money for Britain.<br>    <br>- After the US war of independence, they were sent to West Africa to act as soldiers to guard the African slaves.|
|Free Settlers|- Free settlers were encouraged by the governments of the new land by the awarding of land grants.<br>    <br>- The harsh living conditions of industrial revolution Britain encouraged large numbers of people to want to relocate to new countries like Australia because of the opportunities they offered.<br>    <br>- The new settlements also needed to benefit from those skilled in new technologies.|
|Slaves|- Many industries and businesses in the industrial revolution were founded on money earnt from the slave trade.<br>    <br>- Slaves were used as cheap labour for production during the industrial revolution.<br>    <br>- Technology developed in the Industrial Revolution made slave labour even more productive: The development of the steam engine increased the efficiency of sugar plantations in Cuba, as horses were replaced by machinery.
