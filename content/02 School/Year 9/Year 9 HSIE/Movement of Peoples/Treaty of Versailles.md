**Essay Outline: The Treaty of Versailles**
**Thesis**: *The Treaty of Versailles, designed to establish post-WWI peace, instead sowed the seeds of future conflict by imposing harsh penalties on Germany and failing to address underlying geopolitical tensions.*

---

# **Introduction**

- **Context**: Briefly explain the treaty’s purpose (1919), ending WWI, and its role in reshaping Europe.
- **Significance**: Mention its association with the "War Guilt Clause" and the League of Nations.
- **Thesis**: Highlight its dual legacy—intended to punish Germany but inadvertently fueling WWII.

---

# **Body Paragraph 1: Punitive Measures Against Germany**

- **War Guilt Clause (Article 231)**:
    - Forced Germany to accept sole blame for the war.
- **Reparations**:
    - Massive financial payments (132 billion gold marks) crippled Germany’s economy.
- **Territorial Losses**:
    - Loss of Alsace-Lorraine, colonies, and the Saar Basin.
    - Creation of Poland via the “Polish Corridor.”
- **Military Restrictions**:
    - Army capped at 100,000; demilitarization of the Rhineland.
- **Impact**: Humiliation and economic strain created widespread resentment.

# **Body Paragraph 2: Unintended Consequences and Path to WWII**

- **Political Instability in Germany**:
    - Resentment fueled extremism (e.g., Hitler’s rise via propaganda blaming the treaty).
- **Economic Collapse**:
    - Hyperinflation in the 1920s and Great Depression worsened public anger.
- **Failure of the League of Nations**:
    - U.S. isolationism and lack of enforcement weakened the treaty’s authority.
- **Aggressive Revisionism**:
    - Hitler exploited treaty terms to justify remilitarization (e.g., Rhineland 1936) and territorial expansion.
- **Legacy**: Short-term “peace” gave way to long-term global destabilization.

---

# **Conclusion**

- **Restate Thesis**: The treaty’s harsh terms backfired, enabling WWII.
- **Broader Lessons**: Highlight the dangers of punitive diplomacy and the need for cooperation in peacemaking.
- **Closing Thought**: Link to modern relevance (e.g., importance of addressing root causes of conflict).
