# Convict Transportation from Britain

As we have learnt, growing populations across Europe, and the movement of people from rural villages to rapidly developing towns and cities, resulted in a massive increase in crime rates in Britain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. There was serious competition for available jobs, housing, food and services (such as access to doctors). For some, petty crime was an easy way to earn a living, while for others it was a necessity - a case of steal or starve. Most criminals were poor, unskilled and uneducated. There was little understanding of rehabilitation, so the only response to this growth in criminal activity was punishment. In the late eighteenth century, at least 200 crimes were punishable by execution, including murder, treason and theft of valuable goods.

Those who escaped the death penalty were imprisoned in overcrowded jails, where conditions were far worse than even the poorest slums. When jails became so overcrowded that they could not hold any more prisoners, a new solution had to be found. Rather than building new prisons, criminals were imprisoned on ships that were no longer considered seaworthy. These 'hulks', as they were known, were moored in British harbours and filled with so many prisoners that they were even more cramped and unhealthy than the jails (see Source 1). It was also more difficult to make them secure, so riots and escapes were a constant problem.

In eighteenth-century Britain, new theories for treating and dealing with criminals became popular. One theory in particular was widely supported - that crimes could be stopped by the removal of the 'criminal class' from the wider population. In line with this theory, convicts were first sent to British colonies in North America, such as Virginia and

Maryland. This continued until Britain lost control of these colonies in 1783, after the American War of Independence. It was at this time that Joseph Banks, the botanist who had sailed with James Cook to Australia and the South Pacific in 1770, suggested Botany Bay on the coast of New South Wales as a good location for a new penal colony.

*STRANGE BUT TRUE*

Examples of people who were executed in the late eighteenth century include an admiral killed by firing squad for 'not doing his utmost' in a battle; one man burned at the stake for forgery; and another hanged for 'playing cards with a forged ace of spadesÂ·.

## The Penal Colony of New South Wales

The First Fleet of ships left Britain carrying over 700 convicts on the six-month journey to New South Wales in 1787 (see Source 6). Arriving at Botany Bay on 18 January 1788, it soon became clear that the area was unsuitable for colonisation, so the fleet moved on to Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), landing at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788.

## Other Penal Colonies

Other penal colonies in Australia were later established in Tasmania, at Port Phillip in Victoria, on the Swan River in Western Australia, at Moreton Bay in Queensland, and on Norfolk Island. For more than 80 years, convicts and ex-convicts provided the labour force that helped to develop these Australian colonies by building roads and houses, and clearing dense forests.

## Political Prisoners

A significant category of convicts transported to Australia was made up of political prisoners. These were people who had criticised the king or opposed the authority of the government in some way. Workers who formed the first trade unions were among those sent to the colonies. One such group - six agricultural labourers from the English village of Tolpuddle had set up a union to bargain for wages with local landowners.

They were convicted in 1834 of 'swearing a secret oath' and transported to Australia for seven years. However, the men became popular heroes, and only two years into their sentence they were pardoned and returned to England. For their sacrifice, they earned the title the 'Tolpuddle Martyrs'.

Other political prisoners included:

- **Luddites**
- **Chartists**, who were linked to trade unions and who proposed a People's Charter to give all men the vote and to stop the wealthy from dominating the political process. Chartists played a crucial role in the development of representative democracy in the Australian colonies.

Who were the convicts?

The story of Australia's convict past has often been contested by different historians, academics and everyday people, largely as a result of our uneasy relationship with how it defines us as a country today. This contestability is the result of two ideas working against each other:

- **The desire to forget or cover up the past** - Up until the 1960s, it was common for Australians with transported convict ancestors to hide the fact, because it was considered a stain on the family name. South Australia has always emphasised that, unlike the rest of Australia, it was settled as a free colony; while Van Diemen's Land - which was established as a place to send the most hardened convicts - changed its name to Tasmania in 1856 to remove the association with its past.
- **The desire to mythologise or romanticise the past** - To this day, it is common for certain convicts and settlers from Australia's past to be singled out and held up as examples of people who triumphed over adversity, such as Francis Greenway (a convicted forger who went on to become Australia's first government architect) and Isaac Nichols (a convicted thief who later set up Australia's first post office).

Historians have differing views of the convicts and the kind of people that they were. Some argue that political prisoners protesting against corruption and unfair government policies were not criminals at all, and that the law-breakers who did commit crimes were merely the victims of poverty and harsh laws. Other historians suggest that the convicts were, in reality, hardtflened criminals, and that half to two-thirds of them were repeat offenders who chose a life of crime even though other work was available.

The most common offences that resulted in transportation to Australia after 1788 included pick-pocketing, sheep- and horse-stealing, highway robbery and burglary. Many convicts were from newly industrialised cities, and research has shown that 40 per cent of the convicts transported to Australia in the First and Second Fleets came from the London area. Not all those convicted of a crime were transported. Generally, transportation was reserved for those under 50 years of age who had been convicted more than once. Statistics show that, until 1851, around 30 per cent of the convicts were under 19 years of age.
