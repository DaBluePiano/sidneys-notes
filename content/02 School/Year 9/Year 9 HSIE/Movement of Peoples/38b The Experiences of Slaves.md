# The Experiences of Slaves

Slaves were kidnapped from the north-west coast of Africa - from places such as Guinea (a French colony) or Gold Coast (a British colony). Slave catchers used rope nets to capture young Africans. Often, they were captured while they were out hunting, and their families would never have known what happened to them. They were herded into cages and then loaded onto slave ships.

The conditions under which slaves were shipped to the Americas were brutal. The quarters for the slaves below the decks were little more than leaking, ocean-going dungeons. In summer, the heat was stifling. In winter, the slaves - with little clothing and no blankets or bedding - would shiver with cold. It was almost impossible for slaves to find a comfortable position because of overcrowding and the fact that they were in chains. Much of the time, they were forced to lie in their own urine and excrement. The only relief might come when small groups were allowed briefly on deck, while still in chains, to be hosed down with sea water.

The slaves were fed the bare minimum of food required to keep them alive, in order to reduce costs and maximise profits. They also had only limited access to fresh water.

Many slaves attempted escape during the journey, or tried to end their misery by jumping overboard. Some also refused to eat. Slave-ship captains responded by ordering crew

members to smash the teeth of those troublesome slaves, and force-feed them. Slavers also used a special tool, like a pair of pliers, called the speculum oris. The pointed ends were jabbed

between the jaws of the unfortunate slave and then, with the turn of a screw, the ends opened and forced their jaws apart, sometimes breaking their teeth.

Source 1 An illustration from The Illustrated London News, 20 June 1857, shows how slaves were packed together on board slave ships. They were often forced into painful postures, with barely enough room to turn.

It was common for rebellious slaves to have their hands cut off, and then their heads. The severed body parts were then passed around to other slaves below deck as a warning. For some African tribes, the severing of their heads was the worst imaginable fate, as they believed that without their heads, their spirits would never find their way home. In one terrible case, a newborn baby - whose slave mother had died in childbirth on a slave ship - was left out in the sun to die, and later thrown overboard. The captain was found not guilty of murder because there had been no 'premeditated malice'. The court ruled that he had not planned for the woman to die, and that without a mother the child would have died anyway.

## Transportation of Slaves

|I was soon put down under the decks, and there I received such a greeting in my nostrils as I had never experienced in my life; so that, with the loathsomeness of the stench, and crying together, I became so sick and low that I was not able to eat, nor had I the least desire to taste anything. I now wished for the last friend, death, to relieve me; but soon, to my grief, two of the white men offered me eatables; and, on my refusing to eat, one of them held me fast by the hands, and laid me across, I think, the windlass, and tied my feet, while the other flogged me severely . . . The white people looked and acted, as I thought, in so savage a manner; for I had never seen among my people such instances of brutal cruelty . . . The closeness of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in the ship, which was so crowded that each had scarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us . . . The air soon became unfit for respiration, from a variety of loathsome smells, and brought on a sickness among the slaves, of which many died . . . This wretched situation was again aggravated by the . . .  chains, now . . .  unsupportable, and the filth of the necessary tubs, into which the children often fell, and were almost suffocated. The shrieks of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a scene of horror almost inconceivable.<br><br>  <br><br>Source 2 Extract from the autobiography of Olaudah Equiano, who was captured and sold as a slave in Benin; he wrote about his experiences in The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African, published in 1789|

## Arrival in the Americas

When the slave ships docked at one of the American ports, the slaves were unloaded and prepared for auction. Sores and wounds were covered with tar to make them less visible, and troublesome slaves were given laudanum (made from opium) to sedate them. The slaves were paraded like animals before the interested buyers. Potential purchasers would examine them thoroughly, look in their mouths, feel their muscles, and even comment on their ability as potential breeders of more slaves. The entire process was dehumanising and undignified, and the slaves had no idea where they were or what was ahead of them.

The experiences of African slaves in the Americas varied according to when they were transported, what skills or physical attributes they had, where they were sent, and who bought them. The majority of slaves brought to the southern states of North America and the West Indies worked on plantations and farms. They were given new names, and usually went by the surnames of their masters. They worked long hours in the cotton, sugar or tobacco fields, and lived in simple huts with few comforts. Slaves also worked in the house, and tended animals and vegetable patches. Female slaves were often at the mercy of male members of the household, and the illegitimate children of these masters were also born into slavery.

Slaves who tried to escape were severely punished. Whipping was common for those who were caught, and repeat offenders could have their teeth filed into points so that it was obvious to all that this slave was troublesome.

Under American law slaves were always considered to be property, not human beings.

For example:

- Under the law, slaves could be bought and sold by their owners, and separated from their families.
- Slaves were not allowed to own property of their own, and were not allowed to leave their master's land without permission.
- Laws were passed that made it illegal for slaves to learn to read or write.
- Slaves were not allowed to be out after dark or join with groups of other slaves, except for supervised work or church.
- Slaves were never allowed to hit or challenge a white person, but a white person could kill a slave while punishing them without breaking the law.
- The slave owners attempted to wipe out any memory the slaves had of their African heritage.

There were exceptions, however. Some slave owners taught their slaves to read and write (because it benefited them to do so). There were also slave owners who would never sell or separate families, and others who set their slaves free when the slaves reached retirement age. Many slaves managed to preserve memories of their African heritage, parts of their traditional languages and stories from their past. The music they brought with them from Africa would also survive and become a major contributor to twentieth-century American culture.

In the twenty-first century, an ongoing debate in American society and politics regarding reparations (payment of compensation) for the injustices of slavery has continued to divide Americans. This is important, as much of the American economic system and wealth was built by slaves who never got to share this wealth. Also, many slaves made great inventions throughout this period that became the property of and were patented by their owners, whose wealth was further increased at the expense of the slaves.

These patents are still held by slave owners' families, and reparation has not been made to the descendants of the slaves.
