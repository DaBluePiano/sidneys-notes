# Why Did the Industrial Revolution Begin in Great Britain

The Industrial Revolution marked a period of development in the latter half of the 18th century that transformed largely rural, agrarian societies in Europe and America into industrialised, urban ones. Goods that had once been painstakingly crafted by hand started to be produced in mass quantities by machines in factories, thanks to the introduction of new machines and techniques in textiles, iron making and other industries.

Fuelled by the game-changing use of steam power, the Industrial Revolution began in Britain and spread to the rest of the world, including the United States, by the 1830s and ‘40s. Modern historians often refer to this period as the First Industrial Revolution, to set it apart from a second period of industrialisation that took place from the late 19th to early 20th centuries and saw rapid advances in the steel, electric and automobile industries.

## England: Birthplace of the Industrial Revolution

Thanks in part to its damp climate, ideal for raising sheep, Britain had a long history of producing textiles like wool, linen and cotton. But prior to the Industrial Revolution, the British textile business was a true “cottage industry,” with the work performed in small workshops or even homes by individual spinners, weavers and dyers.

Starting in the mid-18th century, innovations like the flying shuttle, the spinning jenny, the water frame and the power loom made weaving cloth and spinning yarn and thread much easier. Producing cloth became faster and required less time and far less human labor.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeX0uu7iEQTaDTFX2iqsX-8LgGN4403KDBiWik3ZfxIqZZ0QjPOdUzMowHG0Un4cVlfBDKfLVU-Al18NDtiUKvbh2cT6ngG5y-H7FGYvZT09L8Yr0UhoKdICLV4UBbv33vO7Vlu7w?key=hoHmJWnELFnsvAodMA5pcKvf)

More efficient, mechanised production meant Britain’s new textile factories could meet the growing demand for cloth both at home and abroad, where the nation’s many overseas colonies provided a captive market for its goods. In addition to textiles, the British iron industry also adopted new innovations. Chief among the new techniques was the smelting of iron ore with coal (a material made by heating coal) instead of the traditional charcoal. This method was both cheaper and produced higher-quality material, enabling Britain’s iron and steel production to expand in response to demand created by the Napoleonic Wars (1803-15) and the later growth of the railway industry.

## Impact of Steam Power

An icon of the Industrial Revolution broke onto the scene in the early 1700s, when Thomas Newcomen designed the prototype for the first modern steam engine. Called the “atmospheric steam engine,” Newcomen’s invention was originally applied to power the machines used to pump water out of mine shafts.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcLcGTtF5Zws_v_kTMRHf3bffX45Uy7ZrWpuVTE-K171KhpzRkQkpkD7p03M16o0B-wGdppv9ta2n3Sa0kBwYamdILF8l_SiZ5bTpIPBZgtctV-ur0J4Gwap_EukFg3_zsAUXkFBg?key=hoHmJWnELFnsvAodMA5pcKvf)

In the 1760s, Scottish engineer James Watt began tinkering with one of Newcomen’s models, adding a separate water condenser that made it far more efficient. Watt later collaborated with Matthew Boulton to invent a steam engine with a rotary motion, a key innovation that would allow steam power to spread across British industries, including flour, paper, and cotton mills, iron works, distilleries, waterworks and canals.

Just as steam engines needed coal, steam power allowed miners to go deeper and extract more of this relatively cheap energy source. The demand for coal skyrocketed throughout the Industrial Revolution and beyond, as it would be needed to run not only the factories used to produce manufactured goods, but also the railroads and steamships used for transporting them.

## Transportation During the Industrial Revolution

### Evolution of Railways

Britain’s road network, which had been relatively primitive prior to industrialisation, soon saw substantial improvements, and more than 2,000 miles of canals were in use across Britain by 1815. In the early 1800s, Richard Trevithick debuted a steam-powered locomotive, and in 1830 similar locomotives started transporting freight (and passengers) between the industrial hubs of Manchester and Liverpool. By that time, steam-powered boats and ships were already in wide use, carrying goods along Britain’s rivers and canals as well as across the Atlantic.

## Communication and Banking in the Industrial Revolution

The latter part of the Industrial Revolution also saw key advances in communication methods, as people increasingly saw the need to communicate efficiently over long distances. In 1837, British inventors William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone patented the first commercial telegraphy system, even as Samuel Morse and other inventors worked on their own versions in the United States. Cooke and Wheatstone’s system would be used for railroad signalling, as the speed of the new trains had created a need for more sophisticated means of communication.

Banks and industrial financiers rose to new prominence during the period, as well as a factory system dependent on owners and managers. A stock exchange was established in London in the 1770s; the New York Stock Exchange was founded in the early 1790s.

In 1776, Scottish social philosopher Adam Smith (1723-1790) promoted an economic system based on free enterprise, the private ownership of means of production, and lack of government interference.

## Working Conditions

Though many people in Britain had begun moving to the cities from rural areas before the Industrial Revolution, this process accelerated dramatically with industrialisation, as the rise of large factories turned smaller towns into major cities over the span of decades. This rapid urbanisation brought significant challenges, as overcrowded cities suffered from pollution, inadequate sanitation and a lack of clean drinking water.

Meanwhile, even as industrialisation increased economic output overall and improved the standard of living for the middle and upper classes, poor and working class people continued to struggle. The mechanisation of labor created by technological innovation had made working in factories increasingly tedious (and sometimes dangerous), and many workers were forced to work long hours for pitifully low wages. Such dramatic changes fueled opposition to industrialisation, including the “Luddites,” known for their violent resistance to changes in Britain’s textile industry.

In the decades to come, outrage over substandard working and living conditions would fuel the formation of labor unions, as well as the passage of new child labor laws and public health regulations in both Britain and the United States, all aimed at improving life for working class and poor citizens who had been negatively impacted by industrialisation.

## Why Did the Industrial Revolution Start in Great Britain in the 1750s?

Many factors played a part in the development of the industrial revolution in Great Britain. The seeds were sown, quite literally, thanks to the agricultural revolution that enabled the production of food surplus and population growth.

Almost simultaneously, any excess in labor was attracted to larger population centres in search of work and fortune. Institutions like the banks of the time could provide capital (money) to brave entrepreneurs to build new technologies and companies that might not otherwise be able to afford to. Importantly, the rule of property rights also promoted investment and risk-taking. Large structures like factories could now be built on credit. 

The granting of patents (the legal right to own the design of a machine) was now turned into a formalised and legally binding system. This further created confidence for investors and inventors to take a gamble.

Britain also happened to have a wealth of coal, iron, and other resources in a relatively small country, that would help kick start the revolution and feed it. It's small, but growing Colonial Empire also provided a ready-made market for surplus goods, providing further impetus to entrepreneurs and new industrialists.

Initial developments occurred in the cotton industry with the development of the spinning jenny, flying shuttle and power loom, and very soon, other industries would benefit from industrialisation.
