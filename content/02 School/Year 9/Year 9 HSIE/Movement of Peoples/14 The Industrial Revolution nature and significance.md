# The Industrial Revolution Nature and Significance

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXclCsLcebHLa65fEILZ-a1W0WbJE4r5b9DRFDRk6Gr-P2ElxZJPYakmKObprksKMnNJ7MkRk8t8Xsf4Tri60MtCwLikfjZ8lj3YNQ8QQo4bts3ngc7_jNhCJKyRdxonntLYrBEuSQ?key=WQtKy9lGoK_MZ2XUmEUh9PCB)

The Industrial Revolution is the name given to the great changes that began in Britain in the eighteenth century. These changes altered the way in which goods were made, and the way that people lived. The task of making goods was taken out of small homes and villages and placed into large new centres of manufacturing where people, materials and technology were gathered.

Historians regard industrialisation as the biggest change in human history since the coming of the wheel, or the development of agriculture. Like these earlier revolutionary changes, the Industrial Revolution did not begin suddenly, but occurred over a long period of time.

## Australian Manufacturing for the masses![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfH0A4xTOHXnD5WMGUrrDWO0muvQvDPU7dwO-YkUE4qf9lA4A_z5sIJ8oJDwtMzdSCBLQQ4AHY8k0rdXAgixsu0VwkFASbSOnYhaIC_xeMm-87vaulBa4DdBbarnLM7VboVW0Lebg?key=WQtKy9lGoK_MZ2XUmEUh9PCB)

The technology of the industrial revolution was quickly adopted in Britain's most remote colony, New South Wales. Australia's first steam-powered flour mill commenced operation in 1813 at Darling Harbour. Barker's Mill ground wheat so efficiently that by 1826 their production levels required the construction of a five-storey high grain store and a large wharf to enable distribution of processed goods.

Transport and communication links became a priority as Australia's agricultural industry developed. By 1830 steamships were regularly in use in New South Wales, followed by the construction of railway lines in the 1850s. As each of the Australian colonies embraced the new technology of overland telegraphs and developed railway systems, more Australian agricultural products and mass-produced goods were transported to the seaports and the expanding overseas markets.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfWpddVyN_e6-vJTZ45mmc547azDRaTNVgrDsu0mBpP43zNTfzDQIrGqUDWl4DNtXZas1oFkhmhCwASZ26lr3qMmgUpjLcSHp7MkJ1Y3QAWA956rA6wOKJVLh4V4140INHrl7p5Bw?key=WQtKy9lGoK_MZ2XUmEUh9PCB)

The 1851 discovery of gold was one of the most important events in Australia's history. Technology to sink shafts, transport quartz and extract gold was urgently required. The need for mechanised transport increased and new engineering works were established. Australia's economy grew rapidly, affecting every aspect of Australian life. Factories were built to supply a wealthier and larger population with a vastly expanded range of locally produced goods and services.

The Australian economy boomed during the 1880s. Mining dredges for the goldfields, lifts for city buildings, pumps for water sewerage systems and bricks for thousands of new houses were mass-produced in Australia's factories. The power of technology and industry combined with population growth to transform a penal colony into a thriving new nation.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdsJd0ukrR-iR_VHdVB4ls_cTvhfUemGSqx8N5iwy59lQY-tgYFq9zd2Ucv195qPqZEL5HPOs_uqz8IRg0SWqHrTiip2enE5SFYXnnj-UIyoJvOx4BfrnbkidDT7_sWiVfc30Pz?key=WQtKy9lGoK_MZ2XUmEUh9PCB)

## From Revolution to Reform - Significance of the Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution eventually changed the way that people lived all over the world.

- **Structure and organisation of society**: peasants from rural villages became workers living in the slums of industrial towns. The workers were known as the proletariat and the factory owners and managers were known as the bourgeoisie.
- **World population**: increased food production, gradual improvements to living conditions and medical advances led to the growth of the European population from 187 million in 1800 to over 400 million in 1900.
- **Role of governments**: The British Factory Act of 1883 and a range of other laws regulated the employment of children and generally improved working conditions in mines and factories.
- **Contact between regions and countries**: world trade and finance links stimulated economic growth.
- **New political ideas**: the educated middle classes demanded greater representation in government, along with political and personal rights.
- **Technology for warfare**: industrial power and military strength became more closely linked as much larger quantities of armaments were produced.
