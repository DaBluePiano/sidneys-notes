# Industrial Revolution Changing Ways of Life

The rapid growth of factories between 1800 and 1850 affected everybody's lives. Life improved for mechanics - those who built and serviced the machines. They were paid well, and set up 'mechanics institutes' with their own libraries and held regular lectures there. They became part of a growing middle class.

However, for ordinary workers who had moved from the countryside or emigrated from Ireland and Scotland, working and living conditions were poor. Houses were crowded together, with little natural light and no sanitation. To keep the machines running in the factories, people had to work up to twelve-hour shifts. There was little protection from contact with moving machine parts and no compensation for injured workers.

Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) was the son of a wealthy German industrialist. Sent to work in his father's cotton mill in Manchester, Engels began to discover the reality of how working people lived, and in 1845 he published a book on the subject entitled Condition of the Working Class in England.

|Source 2 - In his book, Condition of the Working Class in England, Engels quotes from a police report after two boys were arrested for stealing and eating a half-cooked calf's foot.<br><br>When a policeman went to his widowed mother's house to investigate, he found her with six of her children literally huddled together in a little back room, with no furniture but two old rush-bottomed chairs with the seats gone, a small table with two legs broken, a broken cup, and a small dish. On the hearth was scarcely a spark of fire, and in one corner lay as many old rags as would fill a woman's apron, which served the whole family as a bed, For bed clothing they had only their scanty day clothing.|

## Children

Most children had worked before the revolution - either helping on the farm or in spinning and weaving in the home. They had no schooling and no childhood as we have today. However, working in factories was far worse than working in the home. They were working near dangerous machinery and, being under the control of employers rather than their parents, they could easily be exploited. Yet wages were so low for adults that a family could not survive without children working.

Exploitation was particularly bad where their small size could be seen as an advantage, such as drawing wagons in narrow mine shafts, cleaning underneath machinery or being used as chimney sweeps. Masters of chimney sweeps found it cheaper to force little children through the chimney rather than use a brush.

- evangelical churchmen who felt it their Christian duty to look after the weaker people in society
- rich landowners who resented the new wealthy industrialists
- industrialists themselves who wanted to stop unscrupulous use of cheap labour by their competitors.

A series of bills that passed between 1830 and 1867 gradually led to some regulation of the industry, although the hours worked and the conditions of work were still harsh by today's standards. Some of the most important of these were:

- The Factory Act of 1833, which set legal limits to the working hours of children and was enforced by the appointment of factory inspectors
- The Mines Act of 1842, which banned the employment of women and under-age children in the mines.
- The Ten Hours Bill of 1847, which limited the time worked by women and children in factories to ten hours a day. Because women and children were essential for the running of the machines, it effectively meant that a man's work day was also limited to ten hours.

A series of bills were passed to improve the conditions of children working as chimney sweeps; but because the business was so profitable, these were not enforced and it was not until 1867 that effective legislation was passed.

Source 5 – A historian describes how chimney sweeps were employed.

The very poorest London parents found they could apprentice a child to a chimney sweep much younger than any other occupation. More than this, no apprentice fee was expected, and the master sweep was even ready to pay a sum to the parents for the service of the child, who was thus literally bought and sold. “It was a common practice”, said David Porter, a remarkable master chimney sweeper, “for parents to carry about their children to the master chimney sweepers and dispose of them to the best bidder, as they cannot put them to any other master at so early an age.” (Dorothy George, from England in Transition, Penguin, 1964, pp.123-4.)**
