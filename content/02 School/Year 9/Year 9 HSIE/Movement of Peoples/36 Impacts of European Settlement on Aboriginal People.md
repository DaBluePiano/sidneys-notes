# Impacts of European Settlement on Aboriginal People

## Impact on the Eora People of Sydney

The founding of the convict settlement of Sydney directly resulted in the dispossession of Aboriginal people. Over 30 separate Aboriginal clans had lived in the Sydney region for at least 40 000 years. One of these clans, the Gadigal people, came from the south shore of Sydney Harbour, in the area from Watsons Bay to Sydney Cove. It was the Gadigal people who witnessed the 1788 arrival of the First Fleet at Sydney Cove.

The arrival of the British began the process that saw the Gadigal lose their lands and their self-sufficient, hunting and gathering way of life. The Gadigal and other coastal Aboriginal people in this area were known as the Eora. They lived well on the harbour's fish, oysters, mussels and cockles. The foreshores provided plenty of vegetables, grubs, possums, wombats and kangaroos. The arrival of the British brought competition for clean water and food, and introduced fatal European diseases. The new arrivals cut down trees, desecrated sacred sites, stole Aboriginal spears and fishing lines, polluted waterholes and rapidly extended their control of the land.

Governor Arthur Phillip was under British orders to establish good relations with the indigenous people, so he commanded that 'the natives should not be offended or molested on any account'. The Eora shouted 'Wona worra', meaning 'Go away', but then extended hospitality to the newcomers. The first exchanges between Eora and Europeans on the beaches of Sydney were friendly; beads, mirrors, cloth and gestures of goodwill were exchanged. The newcomers and the traditional owners of the land laughed, joked and danced together.

|Tuesday 29 January 1788 - Landed on a point forming the NW or middle branch to which we were followed by several of the natives along the rocks, having only their sticks which they use in throwing the lance with them. A man followed at some distance with a bundle of lances; they pointed with their sticks to the best landing place and met us in the most cheerful manner, shouting and dancing. The women kept at a distance near the man with the spears.<br><br>  <br><br>This mark of attention to the women, in showing us that although they met us unarmed they had arms ready to protect them, increased my favourable opinion of them very much.<br><br>  <br><br>A.M. Went over to Shell Cove and left this branch, taking it as reported by those who examined it when the boats first came into this harbour. As we left this branch we met several canoes with one man in each of them; they had so much confidence in us as to come close alongside our boats. After fixing the place of the rock and extent of the shoalwater round it we went into the north arm.<br><br>  <br><br>As we were going into the first cove on the east side called Spring Cove, we were joined by three canoes with one man in each. They hauled their canoes up and met us on the beach leaving their spears in the canoes. We were soon joined by a dozen of these and found three amongst them with trinkets &c. hanging about them that had been given to them a week before by the governor on his first visit to this place. Our people and these mixed together and were quite sociable, dancing and otherwise amusing them. One of our people combed their hair with<br><br>which they were much pleased; several women appeared at a distance, but we could not prevail on the men to bring them near us.<br><br>  <br><br>We had here an opportunity of examining their canoes and weapons: the canoe is made of the bark taken off a large tree of the length they want to make the canoe, which is gathered up at each end and secured by a lashing of strong vine which runs amongst the underbrush. One was secured by a small line . . . .<br><br>  <br><br>The governor's plan with respect to the natives was, if possible, to cultivate an acquaintance with them without their having an idea of our great superiority over them, that their confidence and friendship might be more firmly fixed. We could not persuade any of them to go away in the boat with us.<br><br>  <br><br>SOURCE 1 Account of the first British impressions of the Eora by William Bradley, first Lieutenant on the Sirius.|

Behind British goodwill was the clear intention to establish a British prison on Aboriginal land. Within a week of arrival, the British had cleared trees, built the Governor's small cottage and planted a vegetable garden. By 1790 the Eora had names for the uninvited visitors - Berewalgal - people from a distant land. The early attempts at establishing friendly relationships began to fail when the clash over land and culture began.

### A Battle for Survival

The sudden arrival of over 1000 Berewalgal, who did not respect traditional land boundaries and claimed all the Eora land for themselves, placed a huge burden on the limited resources of the area. By the first winter of 1788 the Eora communities were beginning to experience hardship and hunger as the colonists took the best land and the Eora were forced onto the lands of neighbouring clans to hunt and gather food. The battle for survival had begun.

|In December 1788 a group of convicts reported a hostile encounter with a large band of warriors. Governor Phillip feared that relations with the Eora were steadily deteriorating and decided that communication had to be established. The new strategy was to kidnap Eora men, teach them English and send them back to their communities as goodwill ambassadors. Twelve days later an Eora man, Arabanoo, was kidnapped from Manly Beach. He quickly learnt to speak English but died within a year from the smallpox epidemic, called gal-gal-Ja by the Eora.|

### The Spread of Disease

Smallpox spread rapidly and devastated the Eora people. Convict work gangs reported seeing the effects of the disease in April, 1789. Bodies covered in sores were being found in caves or lying unattended at abandoned camp sites. In May, Captain John Hunter noted the absence of the usual signs of Eora daily life around Sydney Cove. Arabanoo, an Eora man who had been taken captive and learned to speak English, was taken down to the harbour to make contact with his family. He found no-one. According to the eyewitness report of David Collins:

|'... not a living person was anywhere to be met with. It seemed as in flying from contagion they had left the dead to bury the dead. He lifted up his hands and eyes in silent agony for some time; at last he exclaimed 'All dead! All dead!' and then hung his head in mournful silence'.|

Arabanoo and the colony surgeon nursed the Eora brought to a camp hospital set up to treat the smallpox victims. Arabanoo caught smallpox from his patients and died on 18 May 1789.

The origin of the disease remains uncertain. An Aboriginal smallpox-marked face was not seen at the time of the first European settlement; and yet during the second half of 1789, the terrible path of the disease could be traced right across Port Jackson, Broken Bay and the Hawkesbury regions. There were no recorded cases of smallpox outbreaks on the First Fleet ships. Some suggested it had come from Macassan fishermen to Australia's north. Others suggested that it had come as smallpox scabs left stuck to the blankets and old clothing given as gifts to the Eora. Whatever the source of the disease, the impact on Aboriginal people was catastrophic. In just over a year, well over half the Eora people of the Sydney region were dead.

|[Arabanoo's] countenance [face] was thoughtful, but not animated; his fidelity [loyalty] and gratitude, particularly to his friend the governor, were constant and undeviating, and deserve to be recorded. Although of a gentle and placable temper, we early discovered that he was impatient of indignity, and allowed no superiority on our part. He knew that he was in our power; but the independence of his mind never forsook him. . . .<br><br>Extract from W.

## European Settlement Expands

As the quantity of harbour fish dwindled and as vegetable supplies were eaten out, the colonists began to hunt and fish in the lands beyond their immediate settlement. The rapid expansion of European settlement continued after the departure of Governor Phillip in 1792, to the land that stretched from Sydney to the foot of the Blue Mountains. This was the land of the Dharug people. The lagoons and creeks of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River and the open grasslands of the plains provided the Dharug with their source of life and culture. The Dharug required a large enough area in which to move about, hunting kangaroos, possums, fish and other animals, and gathering seasonal food such as yams. When the British cleared the land for agriculture, housing and industry, the loss of traditional Aboriginal food sources was complete.

By the 1810s the plains of Sydney had become overcrowded. With the crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813, the search for more pastoral land pushed the frontier of European colonisation into the north-west of New South Wales. European settlement spread into the land of the Kamilaroi, Muruwari and Wailwan people. Along the traditional paths of communication between Aboriginal communities, word spread of the pale strangers who came on unusual beasts.

The British government continued to give land grants to settlers and to big pastoral companies, because sheep farming and wool made huge profits. By 1824, it was clear to the Kamilaroi people of northern New South Wales that the European settlers intended to:

- take possession of the land
- deny Aboriginal people access to the waterholes
- destroy traditional hunting and gathering grounds
- disregard traditional law and sacred sites.

## Losing the Land

The nineteenth-century experience of the Eora and the Kamilaroi peoples was repeated across the continent. The Kamilaroi people were given no compensation or payment for the 223 000 hectares of their land taken by the Australian Agricultural Company in the 1830s. The Kamilaroi were allowed to stay on their land only if employed by the company as stockmen or as domestic servants.

By 1860, the European settlement covered over 400 million hectares of Aboriginal land. As immigrant populations expanded across Australia, Aboriginal people were increasingly left on the outskirts of settlement.

Many Aboriginal people worked on pastoral properties or took refuge on reserves and missions, which were places established for religious conversion or social improvement. European missionaries were inspired to bring Christianity to the Aboriginal people on the missions. They aimed to save the souls of the Aboriginal people by turning them away from their languages and cultural practices. The missions did provide people with basic health and educational services, and some protection from the cruelty and exploitation of the towns and large pastoral properties.

Between 1860 and 1910, laws were passed to 'protect' and separate Aboriginal people from the European population. Aboriginal people were forced from their traditional land and onto the reserves and missions. In New South Wales, the Aborigines Protection Board was established in 1883 to implement the government policy that all 'full-blood' Aboriginal people should live on the 25 New South Wales reserves.

People were encouraged to establish farms on the reserves so that they could become self-sufficient. However, the reserves were located away from towns and on areas of land too small to allow Aboriginal communities to support themselves.

|It was the loss of the land which was worst ... The land itself was now disfigured and desecrated, studded with huts, crossed by tracks and fences, eaten thin by strange animals, dirtied and spoiled, and guarded from its owners by irresistible and terrifying weapons. The all-embracing net of life and spirit which had held land, and people, and all things together was in tatters. The sustaining ceremonies could not be held, men and women could not visit their own birthplaces or carry out their duties to the spirits ...<br><br>- Judith Wright, The Cry for the Dead, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 1981, p. 27.<br>    <br><br>  <br><br>SOURCE 5 Australian poet Judith Wright, in The Cry for the Dead (1981 ), wrote about the despair of Aboriginal communities experiencing the loss of their land.|
