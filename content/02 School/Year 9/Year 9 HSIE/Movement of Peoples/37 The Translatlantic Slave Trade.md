# The Translatlantic Slave Trade

Slavery is as old as human history. It was a feature of life in the ancient world, and also a feature of African history even before the arrival of the Europeans. Traditionally, African tribal leaders made slaves of their captured enemies, although they stayed in their own country and could buy their way out of slavery.

From the 1600s onwards, the European powers began to exploit African resources. This meant looking to Africa for trade goods, territory, and human cargo in the form of slaves. During the 1700s, Britain became a major player in the trade that had previously been dominated by the Portuguese and the Spanish. Britain's participation in the slave trade was driven by the profit motive - merchants were happy because their ships were full (and thus earning money) on each of the three legs of the triangular trade route. At the end of each leg, merchants' profits increased. The slaves they captured in Africa were sold for profit in the Americas, and raw materials such as sugar, tobacco and, later, cotton were taken on board. These were then shipped to Europe for sale. In Europe, cheap manufactured goods were loaded on board and carried back to Africa for sale at a profit.

The pursuit of profit, along with a sense of European superiority, ensured that the slave trade grew rapidly. It lasted until 1833 in the British Empire and until 1863 in the United States.

By the end of the eighteenth century, up to 12 million Africans had been taken as slaves to the West Indies, South America and Britain's American colonies. The size of the slave trade was not just the result of the desire for cheap labour, as the number of sugar, tobacco and cotton plantations increased in the Americas. It was also due to the high premature death rate among slaves. This meant that more slaves were always needed to maintain the size of the workforce.

Unlike convicts, who could have opportunities in a new land after completing their sentences, slaves had very little to look forward to. Slavery usually lasted for life, and a slave's children were born into slavery. These children were often the result of European sexual abuse of women in slavery.

## Transportation of Slaves

Perhaps the most notorious leg of the transatlantic slave trade was the 'middle passage'. This was the section of the journey in which slaves were transported from Africa, across the Atlantic Ocean, to the Americas. The journey lasted anywhere from one to six months.

Before the Act, the 'tight packÂ· method would have meant the ship carried up to 740 slaves.

Slaves were packed below deck, often in chains, where they were forced to lie side by side in cramped conditions with little headroom. Slave ship companies went to great lengths to find the best way of 'packing' their human cargo for shipment. In terms of their business model, the 'best way' was of course the most profitable way, but there was debate about how they could achieve this. Some favoured the 'loose pack' method, arguing that by giving slaves a little more room, not as many would die from the appalling conditions.

Those slaves who did survive the 'loose pack' would also arrive in better condition and fetch a higher price at the slave markets. Others favoured the 'tight pack' method, with many more slaves loaded onto a single ship. It was argued that even if some died or reached the Americas in poor health, there would still be more slaves to sell. 'Tight pack' was generally more popular, on the basis of profits. Of course, it did not take into account the price of human suffering.
