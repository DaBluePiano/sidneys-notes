# Experiences of Ordinary Men, Women and Children

## Life in England

For the millions of people who left their country villages to come to the city, the Industrial Revolution seemed to promise good work and a good wage. In many cases, these hopes were quickly dashed. For most, work in this new world meant very long hours in dangerous conditions for inadequate pay. For others, the new cities offered only unemployment and poverty.

## The Industrial City

The Industrial Revolution created large cities and towns, in which the living conditions for ordinary people were very poor. The need to accommodate all of the new workers in the factories forced the rapid construction of cheap housing resulting in new suburbs of extremely poor quality. Government officials noticed these problems, and frequently sent observers to report on living conditions.

### Factories

![|583x438](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXflemaXpDhr9z09_tdq_OPeGvY6xmAg4i3OuIjv9ObM9qmA3vyKRnGrfBWk1byKl13mKC6AMCAXzrOh4GZbqR7JqtvvIJT6ZeEPDaJMRwKqgHXu21nPvaPat18Nbo0DdExsM9Ak-g?key=_SQTa-WIr3ZkAzmF1RfLiy5W)

The new factories seemed enormous compared with the small workshops people were used to. We can see how they looked from the paintings of Eyre Crowe (see Source 2), who went to Wigan to study the people who worked in them.

This scene accurately shows known buildings such as the Victoria Mills, at the left of the scene, owned by the industrialist Thomas Taylor. Artists often sold their paintings to wealthy industrialists, who expected them to be accurate. The painting still has some limitations as a source for the historian. It only shows the factory girls resting, not working. They are taking a meal break, and seem happy and relaxed. They are well dressed, only one is barefoot, and clean and healthy.

A policeman patrols the street behind them, suggesting that everything is in order. The painter might have depicted a very different scene if he had gone inside the factory.

In most factories, people worked long hours and received low pay. If the workers demanded better wages, the owners dismissed them and took on other desperately poor workers instead. Moreover, the factory you see probably lacked safety equipment. The industrialists argued that safety equipment cost money but made no profits, so there was no point buying it. In the cotton mills, for example, young women like those in the painting worked for years in a factory where the air was full of fine cotton dust. When they breathed it in, it filled their lungs, causing lung disease and finally death. It was possible to buy large extractor fans to remove the cotton dust, but many industrialists argued that it was cheaper to hire new workers to replace those who died.

### Child Labour

One of the worst problems in the new factory was the use of child labour. By law, a child was not allowed to work until the age of six, but few factory owners obeyed this rule.

Once they were employed, children worked very long hours. Those who fell asleep were whipped by their employers to stay awake; some were so exhausted they fell forward into the working machinery and were killed. In some factories, children were employed to use their small hands to clean out the machines while they were still operating, and many were injured when their hands got caught in the moving parts.

Warning Voices

Some of the strongest warning voices of the Industrial Revolution came from the industrialists themselves. Many were businessmen who believed that making profits was the only thing that mattered.

They thought social problems only occurred because working people were lazy or drunk. Others saw the truth. The Industrial Revolution itself was creating bad working conditions, low pay, bad housing, poverty and unemployment.

Robert Owen was a rare industrialist who bravely stated that bad working conditions were the main cause of the dirt, violence and crime in the industrial cities. He suggested that if owners improved the conditions in the factories, workers would also improve their behaviour.

To prove his point, he built a mill at New Lanark, near Glasgow in Scotland. He paid for large windows to let in light and air, plus proper toilets, drainage and even baths. He cut down working hours. He made sure that workers had free time, and encouraged them to read or to exercise during that time. He refused to employ children under the age of 10. He hoped that industrialists would see his successful factory and copy his reforms. When that did not happen, he went straight to the English parliament and persuaded Sir Robert Peel, the then Prime Minister, to pass laws to improve conditions in factories. He even showed working men how to form a trade union. He was so committed to reform that he spent his fortune on ideas to improve the lives of working people.

Workers often had to work long hours, in dangerous conditions, for a wage that was hardly enough to live on. Sometimes workers tried to go on strike, refusing to work until they were given better wages. The employers fought back by dismissals (getting rid of workers), lock-outs (shutting down their factories for a time) and importing labour (getting other workers from areas where there was unemployment). The workers fought back by forming trade unions, in which all members of a trade promised to strike together and support each other.

| Times Gone By . . . . .<br><br>In 1848, after revolutions had swept European countries such as France and Germany, the English novelist Elizabeth Gaskell decided to explain why she had written her novel Mary Barton (1848), with its sad and often alarming descriptions of the hardships of working-class life. She finishes by warning that if something was not done to help the workers, England might experience a revolution in the same way that France did.<br><br>I had always felt a deep sympathy with the care-worn men, who looked as if doomed to struggle through their lives going between work and poverty. A little expression of my sympathy, and the expression of the feelings of some of the working people who I knew, led them to lay their hearts open to me. I saw that they were sore and irritable against the rich. Whether the neglect which they experienced from the wealthy - especially from the masters whose fortunes they had helped to build - were fair is not for me to judge. This belief turns to revenge in too many of the poor uneducated factory-workers of Manchester. Whatever public effort can do in the way of laws, or private effort in the way of kind deeds, should be done as soon as possible. My view of the state of feeling among too many of the factory people in Manchester has received some confirmation from the events that have recently occurred among the workers of Europe.<br><br>Source 4 – This text has been abbreviated and simplified for younger readers.

| Betty Harris, age 37:<br><br>I was married at 23, and went into a colliery when I was married. I used to weave when about 12 years old; can neither read nor write. I work for Andrew Knowles, of Little Bolton (Lanes), and make sometimes 7s (shillings) a week, sometimes not so much. I am a drawer (moving coal carts in the mine), and work from 6 in the morning to 6 at night. Stop about an hour at noon to eat my dinner; have bread and butter for dinner; I get no drink. I have two children, but they are too young to work. I worked at drawing when I was in the family way. I know a woman who has gone home and washed herself, taken to her bed, delivered of a child, and gone to work again under the week.<br><br>I have a belt round my waist, and a chain passing between my legs, and I go on my hands and feet. The road is very steep, and we have to hold by a rope; and when there is no rope, by anything we can catch hold of. There are six women and about six boys and girls in the pit I work in; it is very hard work for a woman. The pit is very wet where I work, and the water comes over our clog-tops always, and I have seen it up to my thighs; it rains in at the roof terribly. My clothes are wet through almost all day long. I never was ill in my life, but when I was lying in.<br><br>My cousin looks after my children in the daytime. I am very tired when I get home at night; I fall asleep sometimes before I get washed. I am not so strong as I was, and cannot stand my work so well as I used to. I have drawn till I have bathe skin off me; the belt and chain is worse when we are in the family way. My feller (husband) has beaten me many a times for not being ready. I were not used to it at first, and he had little patience.<br><br>Source 5 – A woman miner’s evidence included in the Parliamentary Report on English Female miners, Great Britain.

## What Were the Short-term and Long-term Impacts of the Industrial Revolution?

As we have seen, the Industrial Revolution had many appalling short-term impacts. These included the exploitation of labour, grinding poverty and environmental damage. In the long term, the Industrial Revolution increased standards of living in the Western world and provided the infrastructure for modern urban society. It also facilitated globalisation. This involved the rise of international trade-the movement of goods and capital-and the more rapid spread of ideas through new forms of communication. Globalisation, however, had a negative side. It eroded some cultures, and was part and parcel of cultural imperialism. This is related to empire building.

## Global Changes in Landscapes, Transport and Communication

The Industrial Revolution not only changed the way goods were manufactured but also led to changes in the way land was used, as well as changes to transport and communication. Railways, steamships and the telegraph became commonplace.
