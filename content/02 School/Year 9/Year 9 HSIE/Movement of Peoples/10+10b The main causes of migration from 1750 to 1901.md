# The Main Causes of Migration from 1750 to 1901

The period from 1750 to 1901 saw an unprecedented increase in the number of people moving around the world – a process known as migration. Some people moved within their own countries (e.g. from rural areas to urban areas) while others moved between countries (e.g. from England to new colonies in North America and Australia).

There were many reasons why people moved. Historians try to understand the different reasons for migration by organising them into four main categories:

- **economic migration** – moving in search of work. During the Industrial Revolution, mass migration took place as people moved from the countryside to growing towns and cities across England searching for work in factories and mines there. Later, once gold had been discovered in British colonies in Australia, thousands migrated in search of wealth.
- **social migration** – moving for a better quality of life or to be closer to family and friends. With steady work came an improved standard of living. Many people believed that industrial cities offered opportunities for a better life. Others believed that a fresh start in a far-off land offered these opportunities.
- **political migration** – moving to escape political persecution or war. A large number of people who moved from England to other parts of the world during the 18th and 19th centuries were political prisoners or radical thinkers who had criticised the monarch of England or challenged the authority of the government. These people were transported by force or fled persecution of their own accord.
- **environmental migration** – moving to escape natural disasters such as flooding and famine. In Ireland between 1845 and 1852, a period known as the Great Famine (or Irish Potato Famine) led to more than one million Irish men, women and children leaving their homeland in search of a safer environment in which to rebuild their lives.

As well as grouping migrants, historians also consider a range of other factors that influence people’s decisions. These are known as push factors and pull factors. Push factors are negative things that tend to push people away from certain places, whereas pull factors are positive things that pull people towards a certain place. Some examples of push factors include poverty, famine, crop failure, lack of employment, overcrowding, natural disasters, war, and political or religious oppression. Some examples of pull factors include better job opportunities, more space and greater religious and political freedoms.

## Defining Migration and Understanding Different Types of Migrants

Before learning about the events of the period, it is important to define some key terms and groups of people. These terms are used frequently throughout this chapter, so refer back to this list whenever you need to. They include:

- **emigration**: the departure of people from their homeland (country of birth) to settle permanently in a new country
- **immigration**: the arrival of people into a new country to settle permanently
- **migration**: the movement of people within a country or from one country to another
- **convict**: a person found guilty or a crime and sentenced to punishment by a court; convicts in Britain during the 18th century were often transported to serve a sentence in British colonies such as Australia
- **slave**: a person who is considered to be the property of another person and has very few (if any) rights; during the 18th century, many Africans were enslaved by Europeans and taken by force to the Americas
- **free settler**: a person who pays their way and chooses to settle in a new country
- **assisted migrant**: a person who receives assistance from a government or organisation to move to another country.

When learning about the movement of peoples during this period, we need to consider the perspectives of the various people involved. For example, the perspectives and experiences of slaves and convicts will be very different to the perspectives and experiences of free settlers. The perspectives of these different people will have influenced how they viewed or reacted to specific events at the time. They will also have influenced the ways in which people recorded and wrote about their experiences. It is always important to consider the impact that a particular perspective will have on a source.

## Push Factors

Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in 1750, many factors have pushed people towards starting a new life elsewhere. A range of these factors is discussed below.

## The Agricultural Revolution

Until the early 18th century, most people in Europe lived in rural areas and worked in agriculture. Land use had changed little since the Middle Ages, and families often worked the same land for generations. Most peasants worked enough to provide food to feed their families. Their lives were simple and there was a certainty about their roles as members of village communities.

All of this changed with the development of new farming techniques and agricultural machines during the 18th century. The Agricultural Revolution began in Britain but quickly spread to Western Europe. New methods of crop rotation and animal breeding – as well as the invention of machines for ploughing, sowing seed and harvesting – improved crop yields and quality of meat (see Source 3).

Source 3 The seed drill invented by Jethro Tull made the sowing of crops easier and involved far less waste of seed. It also required fewer labourers.

These new approaches to farming were beneficial for the landowners, but forced many peasants off the lands that their ancestors had farmed. Wealthy landowners enclosed fields for planting and grazing. They still required peasants to look after the crops and animals, but the new machines meant fewer labourers were needed. This was the first major example of technology claiming jobs.

The Agricultural Revolution resulted in a wave of migration from the country to newly emerging towns and cities. Many who had lost their livelihoods in villages, especially the young and single, flocked to the towns and cities looking for work. This migration coincided with the Industrial Revolution.

## The Industrial Revolution

At the same time as new methods and machines were modernising agriculture, new approaches to manufacturing and food processing were emerging. The steam engine paved the way for the development of machines such as the locomotive, spinning and weaving machines, pumps to assist mining, and smelters to process the ores.

A vast unskilled or semi-skilled labour force was required to support this new industrial economy. Working conditions were terrible and there were also no laws banning child labour. As a result, children as young as six were put to work in the mines and factories (see Source 4). Their size made them valuable to employers because they could fit into small spaces and climb under machines. They often worked in great danger for very little money.

Source 4 Children were often forced to work in factories during the Industrial Revolution. This was a push factor for some families to emigrate.

The great migration of people into towns and cities across England provided the labour force for the new factories. English cities such as Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham grew rapidly. This resulted in overcrowding and unhealthy living conditions. For many of the poor in these industrial cities, as well as the displaced in rural areas, migrating to new countries in search of a better life provided a way out. A great increase in crime, plus overcrowded jails, contributed to another of the major push factors behind emigration from Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries – the transportation of convicts to penal colonies in North America and Australia.

## Population Growth

During the 18th century, improvements in food production and new discoveries in medicine and hygiene led to a significant increase in population. The birth rate was rising, fewer children were dying and adults, on average, were living longer. Between 1750 and 1800, the population of Britain grew from 6.5 million to 9 million. This population growth created great pressures, especially at a time when new technology on farms and in factories was reducing the number of available jobs. Emigration provided a kind of safety valve in reducing pressure on jobs, housing and resources.

## Natural Disasters: the Irish Potato Famine

Over the centuries, natural disasters have also been push factors motivating groups of people to leave their homelands in order to survive. One such natural disaster took place in Ireland in the middle of the 19th century. It resulted in one of the greatest movements of people from a single country, and occurred as a result of the failure of the potato crop in Ireland.

At the time of the famine, most Irish farmers rented the farming lands on which they lived and worked from wealthy English lords. The majority of crops and animals that the Irish farmers produced on these lands were paid as rent, leaving most peasant families to rely heavily on the potato crop in order to survive. In the 1840s, the potato crop failed several years in a row because of poor soil and a disease called potato blight that made the potatoes inedible. Most landowners refused to waive the rents, which would have enabled the Irish farmers to survive this tragedy.

The result was starvation in Ireland while tonnes of edible crops (paid in rent) were shipped to England. Those who were evicted from their cottages for non-payment of rent often finished up in workhouses where they received only the most basic accommodation and food. Disease was widespread in most workhouses, and the already starving and weakened peasants had little resistance. The most disastrous years of famine were from 1847 to 1849. The famine, which became known as the Great Famine, caused between 1 and 1.5 million deaths and resulted in up to two million people leaving Ireland in search of a better life.

Over the ten years of the Great Famine, the population of Ireland decreased by one-third. A small percentage of those who left Ireland travelled to Australia and New Zealand, but most went to North America because the journey was shorter and cheaper. However, it is estimated that up to one in five emigrants died making the voyage. As a result, the ships they travelled on became known as ‘coffin ships’. Poor sanitation, overcrowding, lack of food and disease meant that many passengers, already weakened by starvation, were not able to survive the journey.

## Discrimination and Persecution

Over the centuries, many waves of emigrants have also left their homelands to escape religious or political persecution. Certain American colonies, for example, were established by Puritans (a group of English Protestants who believed in strict religious discipline) escaping religious persecution in Britain.

Jewish people had suffered discrimination in Europe for centuries and emigrated to escape persecution. They often became scapegoats when times were tough, because some Jews appeared to be more wealthy and successful than other groups in society. However, this perception was often untrue. Many Jewish people, especially in Eastern Europe, were not allowed to own land and were among the poorest peasants. During the 19th century there were organised attacks on Jews (see Source 5). This led to many Jews fleeing to countries like the USA.

## Forced Migration

Not all people who left their homelands during this period of history did so willingly. In fact, the largest number of migrants at this time were forced to move. These groups included slaves and convicts.

From the early 17th century, hundreds of thousands of African people were captured and transported across the Atlantic to America as slaves (see Source 6). This meant they were taken prisoner and then sold as goods. The purpose of this scheme was to provide a free labour force in the North American colonies.

A smaller scheme also involved the capture of people from islands across the Pacific and the transfer of these people to Queensland from the 1860s. These people, who became known as South Sea Islanders, were used as cheap labour on Queensland sugar cane and pineapple plantations (see Source 7).

In addition to the forced migration of slaves, between 1788 and 1868 over 165 000 convicted British criminals – many guilty of only minor crimes – were transported across the world to the Australian colonies. Although these people were forced migrants, great opportunities were offered to those convicts who worked hard and did not reoffend. After their release, many ex-convicts in Australia reflected that transportation had eventually provided a better way of life than they could ever have hoped for in Britain. Only a small percentage of convicts returned to Britain when they had completed their sentences.

## Pull Factors

Some pull factors that encouraged people to migrate during this period included things like the promise of a better life, better employment opportunities, more space, more fertile soil, greater personal freedom and the opportunity to shape the future of an undeveloped land.

Between 1750 and 1901, millions of people were pulled towards particular destinations as a result of a range of these factors. North America and Australia offered stability, democracy and a future. The discovery of gold in both regions during this period also led to a dramatic increase in the population.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, North America, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa offered abundant land that many Europeans saw as theirs for the taking. In some cases, free grants of land were made to attract new settlers. Even when land was not free, prices were usually low and it was relatively easy for newcomers to set up small farms and build new lives. This pull factor, along with a range of other factors, is discussed below in relation to

North America and the Australian colonies.

## North America

From 1775 to 1783, thirteen colonies in North America fought a War of Independence to break free from British control. After winning their independence, a period of growth and expansion began and the country we now think of as the United States of America began to take shape. As people moved west across the country, new settlements and trade routes developed, creating employment and opportunities to own land.

By the late 19th century, other British colonies and settlements across Canada were also starting to expand. Like the USA, Canada had large areas of land available. To encourage development, land was given free to settlers along the route of the Canadian Pacific Railway – a railway line built during the 1880s connecting the east coast of Canada with the west coast.

In 1848, gold was discovered in California. This led to a gold rush that brought around 300 000 people to California over the next five years, transforming the area. This was followed by a Colorado gold rush that led to the development of the area inland from California. Over time, the goal of developing the USA as a land of opportunity that stretched from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west was achieved.

The idea of ‘America’ as a prosperous democracy was a powerful pull factor for the many Europeans who had seen their lives worsen as a result of the Industrial Revolution.

## Idaho Springs

In 1859, gold was discovered in Idaho Springs in Colorado, USA. This began the Colorado gold rush that followed the one in California. Like many areas, Idaho Springs was transformed by the sudden influx of goldminers and the support industries necessary to provide them with goods and services such as tools, meals and accommodation.

It is important to see how both the California and Colorado gold rushes transformed different areas, but it is also just as important to look how these areas stayed the same over time. Sources 1 and 2 are photographs taken over 100 years apart. As a historian, it is important that you train yourself to look for obvious changes, but also take the time to explore continuities. Continuities are often more difficult to recognise, but they are also important in historical study. For example, although the methods of transportation in Idaho Springs have changed, the basic layout of the town and a number of its buildings remain unchanged.

## Australia

When the First Fleet arrived in Australia to establish a British colony in 1788, they were carrying around 750 convicts, soldiers and government officials with them. This was the first British population of Australia. Life was difficult in such a different climate, but gradually the first colony expanded. By the 19th century there were also colonies in Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia.

As exploration opened the continent to settlement, the need for workers increased. Convicts were gradually replaced by free settlers and a new class of assisted migrants (people who were given financial assistance from the government to encourage them to move to Australia).

If workers in Britain possessed a particular skill, employers in Australia could apply for financial assistance to bring them over to settle and work here. Magazines often featured cartoons comparing life in England with life in the colonies (see Source 3). This kind of assisted migration continued throughout the 20th century and was an important way of boosting the number of immigrants arriving in Australia.

The discovery of gold helped transform Australia. Gold was first discovered in New South Wales in 1851. Between 1850 and 1860 the population of Australia more than doubled. In addition to the thousands who arrived in search of wealth on the goldfields (see Source 4) were groups of political refugees (known as Chartists), activists and religious orders. These groups believed there was greater opportunity to think and speak freely, express differing political views and practise one’s chosen religion in Australia.
