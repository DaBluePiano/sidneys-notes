# Free Settlers to the New World

Unlike the convicts and slaves, free settlers moved willingly to start new lives. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, North America, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa were seen as offering abundant land, although no consideration was given for the displacement of Indigenous peoples. In some cases, free grants of land were made. Even when land was not free, prices were usually low, and this was possibly the greatest factor that pulled new immigrants towards these places. The discovery of gold in North America and Australia also led to a dramatic shift in population. In 1750, Europe's population was 163 million, and it grew to 408 million by 1900. Over the same period, North America's population rose rapidly from 2 million to 82 million.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXczSIXHwglkEgZUEDFbkKPzsYXqsJyCRVlY-STzzO-6EAJumG97rhpag-eyjJNHpA0ZpNDt2QlpMKJ0muF6wG6OntUuQL39wdXSxsEUoT-pfcYxso8bx985l5HZBvOgXYK-8kCG?key=7swA_TLspcop97OMhZyVi5B2)

## North America

The British colonies in what we now know as the United States of America fought a war in the eighteenth century (the American War of Independence) to break free of British control. The chance to be a part of a new nation was a powerful 'pull' factor in drawing new immigrants. It led to a period of European expansion, as people moved west across the country, developing new settlements and trade routes. All these changes created more employment and opportunities for Europeans to own land. By the late nineteenth century, Canada, also a British colony, was starting to open up. Like the United States, it had large areas of land available. To encourage development of the west, land was given free to European settlers along the route of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

In 1848, gold was discovered in California, sparking the first gold rush. People from around the world went to the west coast of North America seeking instant wealth, and settled in the new territories (which were not yet part of the United States). Around 300 000 people arrived in California over the next five years, transforming the area. This was followed by a Colorado gold rush in 1859, causing the population of the western region of North America to grow rapidly. A couple of smaller gold rushes also hit Canada around this time, ending with the big Klondike gold rush in the Yukon in 1897.

Because of these gold rushes, North America became known as a land of opportunity. The idea of a prosperous democracy was a powerful 'pull' factor for many Europeans, who had seen their lives become worse during the changes of the Industrial Revolution.

## Australian Colonies

By the 1820s, although convicts and former convicts still made up the largest segment of the population of Australia, there were growing numbers of free settlers arriving. The need for workers had increased as land exploration opened up the continent.

Some settlers were part of a new group of 'assisted migrants', whereby employers could apply for financial assistance to bring workers to Australia if they had a particular skill that was needed. This approach would also be used to boost immigrant numbers in the twentieth century.  

As in the United States, the discovery of gold helped transform Australia. In 1848, mineralogist William Tipple Smith discovered gold near Bathurst in New South Wales, and the gold rush began in 1851. Between 1850 and 1860 the population of Australia almost tripled, from 405 400 to 1 145 600. 

Among those who came to Australia during the gold rush era were a second wave of Chartists and other political refugees. There was a perception that, in Australia, there was  a greater opportunity to think and speak freely, practise one's chosen religion and express differing political views. Many stayed to become settlers in the new nation that would emerge with Federation in 1901.
