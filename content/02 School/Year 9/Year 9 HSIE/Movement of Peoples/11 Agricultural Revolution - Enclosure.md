# Agricultural Revolution - Enclosure

In English History, enclosure was the process which ended the traditional right of all people to use common land to grow crops or raise livestock.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeleYykvox-qEZQVNVlDYhjGwMDvIHYLhm23SzhKkxWGR4JAQeaaHjrIvopTOhy8T6lkwpcn9-7cPW24WzDPjufAna_vgdx9KzQGWKTqy7wY0q0-4iHmMO00_OIvQzrkADaJf5l7A?key=Pix1EM3zuyyKeg7imBI8Ot7z)

Traditionally large sections of land were common land, which allowed people to grow enough (on that land) to survive on and raise their families, without a paid job. This is known as subsistence farming.

The process of enclosure restricted use of land to the owner/s, barring all others from using it. This process started around the 1500s and saw the countryside divided up into a patchwork of fields and paddocks, separated by fences made of stone or hedges.

By the 1800s, most common land in England had been put into private hands. In many cases, the rich used their power to force poor families off the land they inhabited legally for generations, leaving them homeless.

## Contestability

One perspective on the process of enclosure is that enclosure was sometimes accompanied by force, resistance, and bloodshed, and remains among the most controversial areas of agricultural and economic history in England. Marxist and neo-Marxist historians argue that rich landowners used their control of state processes to appropriate public land for their private benefit. This created a landless working class that provided the labour required in the new industries developing in the north of England.

For example, one MArxist view was: "In agriculture the years between 1760 and 1820 are the years of wholesale enclosure in which, in village after village, common rights are lost. Enclosure (when all the sophistications are allowed for) was a plain enough case of class robbery".

Alternately, W. A. Armstrong argued that this is perhaps an oversimplification, that the better-off members of the European peasantry encouraged and participated actively in enclosure, seeking to end the perpetual poverty of subsistence farming. He stated, "we should be careful not to ascribe to [enclosure] developments that were the consequence of a much broader and more complex process of historical change. The impact of the eighteenth and nineteenth century enclosure has been grossly exaggerated....”

## People Move to New Industrial Cities

The Industrial Revolution brought rapid urbanization, or the movement of people to cities. Changes in farming, soaring population growth, and an ever-increasing demand for workers led masses of people to migrate from farms to cities. Almost overnight, small towns around coal or iron mines mushroomed into cities.

Other cities grew up around the factories that entrepreneurs built in once-quiet market towns. The British market town of Manchester numbered 17,000 people in the 1750s. Within a few years, it exploded into a centre of the textile industry. Its population soared to 40,000 by 1780 and 70,000 by 1801. Visitors described the “cloud of coal vapour” that polluted the air, the pounding noise of steam engines, and the filthy stench of its river.

As enclosure locked people off their land, they were forced to move to the big industrial cities looking for work
