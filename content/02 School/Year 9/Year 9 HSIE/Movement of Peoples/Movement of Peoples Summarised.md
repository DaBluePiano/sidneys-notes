# OVERVIEW of MOVEMENT of PEOPLES

## Migration 1750–1901

- Massive global migration occurred due to economic, political, environmental and social factors.
- Migration types: internal (e.g., rural to urban) and international (e.g., Britain to colonies).
- Classified into:
- Economic migration – in search of work and wealth.
- Social migration – pursuit of a better life or reuniting with family.
- Political migration – escaping persecution or war.
- Environmental migration – fleeing disasters like famine or floods.
- Push factors: war, poverty, unemployment, famine, oppression.
- Pull factors: job opportunities, political freedom, land availability.

## 🌾 Agricultural Revolution

- New farming technologies (e.g., seed drill, crop rotation) increased food production.
- Enclosure Movement: common land privatised, displacing peasant farmers.
- Forced migration of rural populations to urban centers (urbanisation).
- Historians debate whether enclosure was exploitation or progress.

## ⚙️ Industrial Revolution

- Began in Britain (mid-18th century) and revolutionized production and labor.
- Steam engine enabled growth in textiles, mining, and transportation.
- Rise of factories created demand for unskilled labor; led to:
- Mass urbanisation.
- Overcrowded, polluted cities.
- Poor working and living conditions.
- Child labor widespread; dangerous environments for workers.
- Sparked later reforms: Factory Acts, Mines Acts, trade unions.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Population Growth

- Improved medical care and food supply led to population surge.
- Britain’s population grew from 6.5M to 9M (1750–1800).
- Pressure on housing, jobs and resources pushed migration.

## 🍽️ Irish Potato Famine (1845–1852)

- Potato blight caused mass starvation; over 1 million deaths.
- Over 2 million emigrated (mainly to North America).
- Conditions on emigration ships were horrendous – many died en route (“coffin ships”).

## 🕊️ Persecution and Discrimination

- Religious and political persecution triggered migration:
- Puritans left Britain.
- Jews fled pogroms in Eastern Europe.
- Migrants sought freedom in North America and Australia.

## 🔗 Forced Migration: Slaves & Convicts

- Slavery:
- 17th–19th century: millions of Africans enslaved and shipped to the Americas.
- Worked on plantations (sugar, cotton, tobacco).
- Profits from slavery funded Britain’s industrialisation.
- South Sea Islanders: taken to Australia to work on plantations (blackbirding).
- Convict Transportation:
- 1788–1868: 165,000 British convicts sent to Australia.
- Transported for minor crimes due to overcrowded prisons.
- Some became successful settlers after completing sentences.

## 🛳️ Free Settlers & Assisted Migration

- Many migrated voluntarily to escape poverty and seek better opportunities.
- Free settlers paid their way.
- Assisted migrants had travel costs subsidized by governments.
- Skilled labor (e.g., carpenters, blacksmiths) in demand in colonies.
- Posters and publications promoted migration to colonies.

## 🌎 Pull Factors by Region

### North America

- After U.S. independence (1776–1783), land opened up for settlement.
- Gold rushes (California 1848, Colorado 1859) attracted 100,000s.
- Land grants along Canadian Pacific Railway attracted settlers.
- Promoted as a land of democracy and prosperity.

### Australia

- First Fleet (1788) established penal colony in New South Wales.
- Gold discovered in 1851 (NSW & Victoria) → population tripled (1850–1860).
- Australia seen as a land of opportunity and freedom.
- Land grants encouraged migration.
- Farming was the main occupation of free settlers in Australia
- Political refugees (e.g., Chartists) sought free speech and reform.

## 🧑‍🏭 Life for Workers During Industrial Revolution

- Cities like Manchester exploded in size, often lacking sanitation or safety.
- Poor housing, pollution, and disease were rampant.
- Factory work was grueling, dangerous, and low-paid.
- Children exploited in factories and mines.

## 💥 Reactions and Reforms

- Reformers like Robert Owen advocated for improved working conditions.
- Parliamentary Acts gradually regulated child labor and working hours:
- Factory Act (1833): limited child labor.
- Mines Act (1842): banned women/children underground.
- Ten Hours Act (1847): limited workday to 10 hours.

## 📜 Perspectives and Contestability

- Historical interpretations vary:
- Marxist historians: Enclosure = exploitation by elites.
- Others: Enclosure = necessary modernization.
- Convict legacy is contested: shame for some, pride for others.
- Romanticised stories of successful convicts (e.g., Isaac Nichols).

## 🇦🇺 Impacts on Indigenous Australians

- British colonisation led to:
- Dispossession of Aboriginal land.
- Resource competition and cultural clash.
- Spread of European diseases (e.g., smallpox).
- Initial peaceful contact with Eora people turned into conflict and loss.

## 🔄 Triangular Trade & Industrialisation

- Slave labor in the Americas (cotton, sugar) supported Europe’s industrial growth.
- Britain’s global trade network built on exploitation and colonisation.

## 📈 Long-term Impacts of the Industrial Revolution

- Technological progress revolutionized economies and warfare.
- Urban growth and infrastructure expanded.
- Gradual improvements in public health, sanitation, and workers’ rights.
- Led to rise in democratic reform and class consciousness.
