# Convicts, Free Settlers and Slaves

## Transportation and Migration

The Enclosure Acts and the Industrial Revolution drove country people to the cities in the search for new forms of work. The population of Britain grew and the cities became more crowded. Conditions in the city deteriorated as streets were filled with garbage and sewage, and disease spread. The difference between the lives of the privileged rich and the despairing poor was probably greater at this time than any other period in British history. Approximately one-tenth of the English population, and one-quarter of the Irish population, were destitute.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdmhVVICHH4PxrvpBWkdQmjiYIKWgfnWaP-hi7I450Cqm13w6LhPN1J-E-xw3lxtV1gdg1H22wcpWLRCcd1I90VeIcqBVspV1zWzqT8pItAif2wOk8XY8Ekr-3bmSUGQKlLsLi8?key=tZNnXwgHKOHL3gM6Bl7JCbo1)

Children as young as six years of age mined the coal that was driving the engines of the Industrial Revolution and worked the factory mills that produced the cloth. Children continued to toil in the British mines until 1860.

## Convict Transportation

Without jobs and a future many people turned to crime. Their choice was between stealing or starving. At this time there was no organised police force and no real way of managing the serious social problems of eighteenth and nineteenth-century Britain. The British government responded to the crime wave by sentencing more criminals to death. Executions were carried out in public to act as a reminder to criminals of what would become of them if caught. By the early nineteenth century there were 200 different crimes punishable by death.

The other major form of punishment was transportation. Most of the convicts were people who had been found guilty of theft. After being sentenced to transportation, prisoners were chained in rat-infested convict ships, called hulks, until space was available on seaworthy transport vessels that would carry them across the globe.

During most of the eighteenth century, prisoners were usually transported to the Americas. The British government sold their convict labour to the American planters as a punishment, which also earned Britain money. The use of this criminal workforce in the Americas was disrupted by the revolution of 1776. Britain’s crushing defeat in the American War of Independence brought an end to North America as Britain’s criminal dumping ground.

The British government began a plan to ship her criminals to West Africa. Many were transported in leg irons on slave ships, bound for Africa’s coastal slave forts. Convicts were sent to West Africa to then work as convict-soldiers, assigned to guard captive Africans waiting to be sold into slavery. In 1781 murder and mutiny destroyed Britain’s West African plan for her banished criminals. The British government then decided to transport her convicts to the distant shores of the great south land, Australia.

## Free Settlers — Migration to Australia

The hardships of Industrial Revolution Britain created crime and a constant supply of convicts for transportation to Australia. It also created a large number of potential migrants. Hardship pushed people to look to the world beyond for the opportunity to build a better way of life. The government of the penal colony encouraged free settlers to make the long journey halfway around the world. Within five years, free settlers were arriving in the colony. They were given land grants by the governor and the use of convict labour to farm their properties. Between 1830 and 1850 over 200 000 people made the journey to Australia. They came of their own choice, and they came to stay.

|That the skilful farmer would be enabled to obtain an independent and comfortable subsistence is, however, indubitable; and the larger his family, provided they were of sufficient age to afford him an effectual co-operation, the greater would be his chance of a successful establishment. Hundreds of this laborious class of people, who in spite of unremitting toil and frugality, find themselves every day getting behind-hand with the world, would undoubtedly better their condition by emigrating to this colony, if there were only a probability that they would be enabled to go on from day to day as they are doing here. In this country they are at best but tenants of the soil they cultivate; whereas there they would be proprietors, and the mere advance which would be taking place in the value of their farms, would before many years not only render them independent but even wealthy …<br><br>  <br><br>For the artisan and mechanic, who are skilled in the works of utility, rather than luxury, there is, as it has been already remarked, no part of the world, perhaps, which affords an equal chance of success. To any, therefore, who have the means of transporting themselves and families to this colony, the removal would be in the highest degree advantageous. They could not fail to find immediate employment, and receive a more liberal return for their labour, than they would be able to procure elsewhere. The blacksmith, carpenter, cooper, stone-mason, brick-layer, brick-maker, wheel and plough-wright, harness-maker, tanner, shoe-maker, taylor, cabinet-maker, ship-wright, sawyer, &c. &c. would very soon become independent, if they possessed sufficient prudence to save the money which they would earn.<br><br>  <br><br>The advantages, however, which the colony offers to this class of emigrants, great as they undoubtedly are, when considered in an isolated point of view, are absolutely of no weight when placed in the balance of comparison against those which it offers to the capitalist, who has the means to embark largely in the breeding of fine woolled sheep.<br><br>  <br><br>Source 3 In 1819 the explorer and politician W.C. Wentworth wrote a book about the colony. In his book he set out his vision of Australia and the opportunities offered to free settlers in the new land.|

## The Slave Trade

Sixteenth-century Europe established a global trade network. This international trade made it possible for valuable products such as maize, sugar, silver, coffee, tobacco and cotton to be purchased in European marketplaces. Europeans were at the centre of this world trade because they built great ocean-going fleets of trade ships, and they controlled the vast plantations and mines producing these valuable goods.

The Spanish were the first Europeans to take land in the Americas for mining and farming. Sugar was in great demand in Europe and so planters established vast holdings in the Caribbean and South America. Plantation work was long and hard. Native Americans died in their millions from the unhealthy conditions they worked under, and from the effects of the diseases spread by the European settlers. The Spanish and Portuguese colonists looked for alternative sources of labour and found African slaves who could meet the demands of American agriculture and mining. The slave trade to the Americas was pioneered by the Portuguese who used African slaves on their plantations in the Cape Verde Islands, off the coast of west Africa, and in the Madeira Islands located in the Atlantic. The British soon joined the slave trade because of the huge profits that could be made.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfJYn68zf4kD5sz0buusA634RqNzgCpoE4TGY6XOZP3WHxwdZpEKoGKNNJAGLKwwIvJfq4JV-PJwLu2KVvr-VME5g5kvE-lGx9LBt547FqDXoI-icADafnD0PCxupmlShHinQ3hIg?key=tZNnXwgHKOHL3gM6Bl7JCbo1)

By the eighteenth century the cheap labour provided by millions of African slaves was allowing Europeans to prosper. Slave traders were among the richest people in eighteenth-century Britain.

## The Triangular Trade

As the numbers of European settlers across the Americas steadily increased, the ‘Triangular Trade’ developed (see source 6). Ships laden with European goods sailed to Africa, collected a cargo of slaves and then sailed back to Europe with valuable American trade goods such as sugar and cotton. The Atlantic crossing between Africa and the Americas was called the Middle Passage.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdI5AK0qOVy9K-p7zJomcv2--b-PxT395stqZJZcldkqTiTIbi6ty30dDQACesWwDkNaF1fsMTljHMEUnmU18f3x2dihbn4TsNLdj3OJTUXhXFxcZO8t90Rpyi-2oJXqzkUjN9J?key=tZNnXwgHKOHL3gM6Bl7JCbo1)

## Slaves to Industry

The wealth from the slavery of the American plantations helped to build the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain. Much of the British technology that changed the world was developed from the profits made by slave traders. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the British government received millions of pounds in revenue from the slave trade, and the taxes and duties that accompanied it.

The goods produced by approximately six million slaves working the fertile soils of America, Cuba and Brazil continued to stimulate the commercial growth of Europe. By the end of the eighteenth century, approximately 60 thousand slaves were transported each year to the Americas. Two and a half million slaves were employed at any one time in the production of sugar, tobacco and cotton.

Technology developed in the Industrial Revolution made slave labour even more productive:

The development of the steam engine increased the efficiency of sugar plantations in Cuba, as horses were replaced by machinery. The sugar mills operated non-stop, and were worked by slaves on 18-hour shifts.

In 1807 the British Parliament passed an act making it illegal for British ships to carry slaves, or for British colonies to import slaves. Despite the abolition of slavery, the profits from the trade continued to flow into the marketplaces of Britain. The southern states of America depended on the wealth that came from slave labour for their development, and refused to abolish the slave trade. Spain and Portugal also refused to abolish slavery and so the trade continued until the end of the nineteenth century.

Slaves bought in Africa produced sugar on plantations in the Caribbean that fed people in Europe, including by the eighteenth century workers who were making England’s industrial revolution and providing goods that people across the world wanted to buy.

English planters made their fortunes in the colonies and then returned to Britain and a life of luxury:

- William Beckford was a plantation owner in Jamaica. Upon his return to Britain he became the Lord Mayor of London, known for his lavish dinner parties.
- Famous businesses such as Barclays Bank and The Phoenix Insurance Company were established from profits from slave plantations.
- Britain’s Prime Minister Gladstone invested the wealth made from his plantations to build his trade empire, which included the Liverpool to Manchester railway.
- London slave traders invested their fortunes in the newly developing industries, such as the manufacturing of textiles. During this period the city of Manchester became known as Cottonopolis, the city of cotton, because of the huge quantity of fabric manufacturing.
