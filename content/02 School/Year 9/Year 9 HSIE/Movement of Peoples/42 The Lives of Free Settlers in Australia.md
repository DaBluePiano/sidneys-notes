# The Lives of Free Settlers in Australia

Settlers, squatters and selectors

Early settlers in Australia came in search of a better life, or to make their fortune. Some settlers had agricultural backgrounds, but others, such as the military officers who were given large land grants, had no farming experience.

Squatters were settlers who cleared stretches of Crown land and occupied them with their sheep and cattle, without official ownership. They lived on the frontiers, far away from government regulation and supplies. Squatters were often the first Europeans to explore parts of inland Australia, and chose the most fertile land to settle on. The government later

gave licences to squatters, allowing them to lease the land they already occupied. Some squatters became very wealthy and were the pioneers of Australia's wool industry.

In the 1860s, the governments of the Australian colonies dispossessed Aboriginal people and sold blocks of land that they had previously leased to squatters. The new settlers who bought small areas of land to farm were known as selectors. Wealthy squatters purchased most of the fertile land they had cleared and worked, and selectors were often left with the poorest farming land without easy access to water.

The life of settlers in Australia could be harsh. Even with the help of convict labour and Aboriginal people who may have been able to stay on their traditional lands in return for unpaid work, it could take years to clear their land of trees, and establish their crops and livestock. Food was scarce, and settlers initially lived in basic bark shelters, or built 'wattle and daub' huts made of tree branches and clay.

[T]he selector's ... stock of ready money is usually exhausted by the time he has ringed and felled a few trees upon the site of his future homestead, erected a hut of slabs and bark, furnished it with a trestle bed and blankets, a rudely-constructed table and bench, a few cooking utensils, an axe, a spade, a crosscut saw, and a supply of flour, tea and sugar ... and when he has broken up a few perches of land and put in his first crop, he is not unfrequently compelled to seek for work in the neighbourhood at fencing or road-making, in order to maintain himself until the 'kindly earth' shall have yielded him her increase [produce a crop] ... In some cases the free-selector, who is fortunate enough to be the possessor of a horse and to be quick and dextrous [skilled] in the use of the shears, sets out in the beginning of August for the woolsheds in the south of Queensland, or in the north of New South Wales, to fulfil a yearly engagement at sheep-shearing ... returning in time to gather in his own crops, and with cheques in his pocket representing at least a hundred pounds ... He is thus enabled to purchase a few head of stock or a better description of plough, to build a more commodious [spacious] hut, and to supply the wife and children, for whom he has been making a home in the bush, with such articles of wearing apparel [clothes] as they may stand in need. There is plenty of hard work and very little recreation in such a life ...

Each stockman's hut stood by itself in a clearing, leagues distant [miles away] from any other dwelling, and as far as might be from the nearest scrub, in the thickets of which the Blacks could always find an unassailable stronghold.

The settler depended for safety upon the keenness of his hearing, the excellence of his carbine [rifle], and the Blacks' superstitious dread of darkness, which makes them averse to leaving their camp except on moonlight nights, or with an illumination of burning firesticks.

Then there was a garden, fenced in with hurdles, over which our tame kangaroo took his daily constitutional [walk]; but nothing grew in it except pumpkins and fat-hen [a type of weed]. Well for us that they did flourish, for we lived on pumpkins and mutton for three months, during which time the drays were delayed by flooded creeks, and the store was empty of flour, tea, sugar, and all other groceries.

## The Gold Rush in Australia

The discovery of gold in 1848 at a sawmill in California sparked a gold rush that led to the spectacular growth of the west coast of the United States. As people flooded to the goldfields, San Francisco was transformed from a city of 1000 people in 1848 to more than 25 000 people by the end of 1849.

Edward Hargraves was one of the hopefuls who had travelled there. He was unsuccessful at finding his fortune in California; however, after returning to Australia he took advantage of the New South Wales Government's failure to acknowledge William Tipple Smith's 1848 find near Bathurst, west of Sydney, and claimed in 1851 that he had discovered gold in the same area. This well-publicised 'discovery' sparked the gold rush in Australia.

Living conditions were hard for everyone on the Australian goldfields. In places such as Bendigo, for example, around 40 000 people lived close together in tents. Water and fresh food were scarce. Garbage piled up around the diggings, and toilets were simply holes dug in the ground. The unsanitary conditions and poor diet led to diseases such as dysentery and typhoid. Most 'diggers' worked from dawn until dusk, six days a week.

It is estimated that more than 80 per cent of the population on goldfields were male, as women generally remained at home with their children. Some women did brave the difficult conditions to keep the family together, but they risked death or disease from the lack of sanitation and medical care. Children under the age of five made up the majority of deaths on the goldfields.

In the early years of the gold rush, most miners were able to make reasonable returns, and 'alluvial gold', which washed up in creek and river beds, was relatively easy to find. By the 1850s, however, much of the alluvial gold had already been found, and miners had to dig mine shafts to find veins of 'reef gold', which occurred many metres underground.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcI0Bjrl8T7HEmome-ivF0Cgwe_zpDluNeG1S-DmUE-Nq5_PpTwdyPOU6986k40n9EXzhGKFJtNUSBhlYejIGTadrhNDVxlggB72ZkXUsq1HMsek4KDw11m_QBkcZ226ihjRDN-fA?key=oOEGvgofKdDPW4NCdflbR_Ts)

All miners had to pay a licence fee, which was bitterly resented. It became one of the factors that contributed to the Eureka Rebellion in 1854.
