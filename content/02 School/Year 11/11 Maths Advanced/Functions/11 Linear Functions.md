# Identifying Key Features

The graph of a linear relationship will create a line. All linear functions can be written in either of these two common forms:

| Gradient Intercept Form | General Form |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |
| $y=mx+c$                | $ax+by+c=0$  |

 If we sketch a linear relationship on a plane, the straight line formed will be one of the following types:

 - An increasing graph means that as $x$ values increase, the $y$ values increase.

- A decreasing graph means that as $x$ values increase, the $y$ values decrease.
- A horizontal graph means that as $x$ values change the $y$ values remain the same
- In a vertical graph the $x$ value is constant.
Regardless of all different shapes all linear functions have some common characteristics.

# Intercepts

They all have at least one intercept.  Linear functions might have

- an $x$ intercept only (in the case of a vertical line)
- a $y$ intercept only (in the case of horizontal lines) 
- or some have $2$ intercepts, both an $x$ and a $y$ (in the case of increasing or decreasing functions)

> [!NOTE] Intecepts
> The $x$ intercept occurs at the point where $y=0$.
The $y$ intercept occurs at the point where $x=0$.

# Gradients

The gradient (slope) of a line is a measure of how steep the line is. For a linear function the gradient is **constant**. That is as the $x$-value increases by a constant amount, the $y$-value also increases by a constant amount. We can calculate the gradient from any two points $(x_{1}​,y_{1})$, $(x_{2}​,y_{2}​)$ on a line:
