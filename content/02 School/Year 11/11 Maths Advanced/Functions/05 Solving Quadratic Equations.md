# Quadratic Equations

The three equations below are considered quadratic equations due to the highest index of $2$ on any $x$ term.

$$\begin{array}{c}{{x^{2}=25}}\\ {{2x^{2}-4x=4}}\\ {{x^{2}+5x-6=0}}\end{array}$$

There are a number of ways to solve quadratic equations. The solutions to quadratic equations are also called the **roots** of the equation - we will cover this language in more detail in a later section.

# Solving Quadratic Equations

## Methods

### Algebraically Solve

for simple binomial quadratics such as $x^2=49$ which have no $x$ term, we can rearrange and solve using a square root. Remember that when we take a square root we need to consider both the positive and negative root. For example:

$$\begin{array}{r c l}{x^{2}}&{=}&{49}\\ {x}&{=}&{\pm7}\end{array}$$

### Factorise

fully factorising a quadratic allows us to use the null factor law: if $a\times b=0$ then at least one of $a=0$ or $b=0$ must be true. For example:

### Completing The Square

this method involves rewriting the equation such that there is only one $x$ present. We can then continue to solve the equation algebraically.

If the quadratic is not easily factorisable, then we can either **complete the square** or use the quadratic formula.

Solve the quadratic equation $x^2+4x-5=0$ by first completing the square.

$$\begin{array}{r c l}{x^{2}+4x-5}&{=}&{0}\\ {\left(x+2\right)^{2}-9}&{=}&{0}\\ {\left(x+2\right)^{2}}&{=}&{9}\\ {x+2}&{=}&{\pm3}\\ {x}&{=}&{3-2,\ -3-2}\\ {x}&{=}&{1,\ -5}\end{array}$$

We can also complete the square using an algebraic method. The steps involved in this are:

- Move the constant term to the other side of the equation
- Take half of the coefficient of $x$, square it, and add the result to both sides to keep the equation balanced
- Complete the square
 $$\begin{array}{r c l}{x^{2}+4x-5}&{=}&{0}\\ {x^{2}+4x}&{=}&{5}\\ {x^{2}+4x+4}&{=}&{5+4}\\ {(x+2)^{2}}&{=}&{9}\\ {x+2}&{=}&{3-2,\ -3-2}\\ {x+2}&{=}&{\pm3}\\ {x}&{=}&{3-2,\ -3-2}\\ {x}&{=}&{1,\ -5}\end{array}$$

### Quadratic Formula

using the quadratic formula $$x=\,{\frac{-b\pm{\sqrt{b^{2}-4a c\ }}}{2a}}$$

will find the solutions to any quadratic equation in the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$. The quadratic formula is useful when we can't algebraically solve, find a nice integer factorisation of the quadratic or completing the square introduces fractions into the working.

## Strategy

When looking to solve a quadratic, we should start by checking the simplest options:

- Is there an $x$ term in the quadratic? If not, we can solve it straight away algebraically
- Are there any common factors that we can take out to simplify the quadratic?
- Can we find an easy factorisation with nice integers?
- If not, consider completing the square or using the quadratic formula

> [!Warning] Careful!
> Some quadratics might look like they are factorised and ready to be solved using the null factor law, but have additional terms on the other side - such as the equation $(x−3)(x−4)=2$.
The null factor law only works if the other side of the equation is zero!

# Other Quadratic Equations

We might come across equations with fractions that don't look like quadratic equations at first glance. For example, the equations $x−4=-\frac{6}{x}$​ and $\frac{1}{x}−\frac{1}{x+1}​=\frac{1}{2}$​ don't immediately look like quadratic equations. If we multiply each term by the lowest common denominator, however, we can see the true quadratic nature of the equation. For example, if we multiply both sides of $x−4=-\frac{6}{x}$ by $x$ we get:

$$\begin{array}{r c l}{x^{2}-4x}&{=}&{-6}\\ {x^{2}-4x+6}&{=}&{0}\end{array}$$
