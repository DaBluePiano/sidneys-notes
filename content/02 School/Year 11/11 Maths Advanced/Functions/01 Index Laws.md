An expression in the form of $a^n$ is called an exponential expression. The letter $a$ is called the **base** and the $n$ is called the **exponent** or **index**. Both the base and index can be a positive or negative integer or fraction.

# The Index Laws

## The Product Rule

The product rule applies when we have the **product** of multiple exponential expressions with the **same** base and states:

$$a^n\times a^m=a^{n+m}$$

## The Quotient Rule

The quotient rule applies when we have multiple exponential expressions with the **same** base **divided** by each other and states:

$$\frac{a^m}{a^n}=a^{m-n}$$

## The Zero Index Rule

The zero index rule applies when any number or expression is raised to the **power of 0** and states:

$$a^0=1$$

## The Power of a Power Rule

The power of a power rule applies when we have an exponential equation raised to the **power of another exponent** and states:

$$(a^m)^n=a^{mn}$$

## The Negative Index Rule

The negative index rule applies when we have exponential expressions with a **negative** index and states:

$$a^{-m}=\frac{1}{a^m}$$

## The Fractional Index Rule

The fractional index rule applies when we have an exponential expression with a **fractional** index and states:

$$a^{\frac{m}{n}}=\sqrt[n]{a^m}$$

## The Fractional Base Rule

The fractional base rule applies when we have a **fractional base** number raised to a power and states:

$$\left( \frac{a}{b} \right)^m=\frac{{a^m}}{b^m}$$

> [!Warning] Same Bases!
> Be careful when applying index laws making sure that they are of the same base, for example the index law **cannot** be applied directly if trying to solve $3^x \times 9^x$ because $3\ne 9$.
