# Piecewise Functions

Finally, functions don't need to be defined by just one equation. A **piecewise function** specifies different function rules based on certain intervals of $x$ values. These functions may have gaps on their graphs - we call these discontinuous functions - but as long as there is only one $f(x)$ value for any given $x$ value, it is still a function! The image below shows a piecewise function that we can write as:

$$f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2 &\text{if } x\geq-1 \\ x+2 &\text{if } x<-1 \end{cases}$$

 We could use either the graph or the equations to evaluate function values, but let's practice using the equations by choosing an $x$ value that isn't shown in the sketch.

For example, let's find $f(5)$. This requires an $x$ value greater than $−1$, so we choose the top equation in the piecewise set. So, $f(5)=x2=25$.
