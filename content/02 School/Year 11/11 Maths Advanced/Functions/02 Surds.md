Surds are expressions such as $\sqrt{ 3 }$ or $\sqrt{ 39 }$, which contain a root that can't be simplified to an integer or fraction. They are a special type of irrational number (which means they can't be written as a fraction or a ratio).

# Surd Rules

There are three key results that we utilise while operating with surds:

> [!Information] Surd Laws
> $$\sqrt{ ab }=\sqrt{ a }\times \sqrt{ b }$$
> $$\sqrt{ \frac{a}{b} }=\frac{\sqrt{ a }}{\sqrt{ b }}$$
> $$\sqrt{ a }^2=\sqrt{ a^2 }=a$$

# Simplifying Surds

Sometimes an expression in the form of $\sqrt{ a }$ is a surd and cannot be expressed as a rational number, but can be simplified by rewriting the larger surd using a smaller one. The key to simplifying a surd of the form $\sqrt{ a }$ is to find the highest factor of $a$ that is a **perfect square** (a number that has an integer square root) for example:

$$\begin {align}
\sqrt{ 20 }=&\sqrt{ 4\times 5} \\
=&\sqrt{ 4 }\times \sqrt{ 5 } \\
=&2\sqrt{ 5 }
\end{align} $$

This is called a *simplified surd*.

If we had chosen to split $\sqrt{ 20 }$ into $\sqrt{ 2 }$ and $\sqrt{ 10 }$ instead, we would not have been able to simplify any further as none of them are square numbers. 

# Multiplication and Division of Surds
When using the surd rules to solve multiplication and division questions involving surds, remember to multiply or divide any numbers together in one group and the surds together in another.
$$\begin{array}{l c l}{{2\sqrt{\;2\;}\times3\sqrt{10}}}&{{=}}&{{2\times3\times\sqrt{\;2\;}\times\sqrt{10}}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{6\sqrt{20}}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{6\sqrt{4\times5\;}}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{6\times2\sqrt{5\;}}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{12\sqrt{5\;}}}\end{array}$$
# Addition and Multiplication of Surds
The rules above show that any two surds can be combined through multiplication or division. On the other hand, only "like surds" can be added. That is:
$${\sqrt{a\,}}+{\sqrt{b\,}}\quad\neq\quad{\sqrt{a+b\,}}$$
Similarly for subtraction of surds:
$${\sqrt{a}}\,-{\sqrt{b}}\quad\neq\quad{\sqrt{a-b}}$$
If the surds **are** the same value, then we have:
	$$\sqrt{a}\,+\sqrt{a}\quad=\quad2\sqrt{a}$$   
This can be extended to adding or subtracting multiples of surds - for example:
$$\begin{array}{l l l}{5{\sqrt{3\ }}-3{\sqrt{3\ }}}&{=}&{2{\sqrt{3\ }}}\end{array}$$
This is exactly the same as collecting like terms, except that we are looking for matching surds instead of pronumerals.

We can combine this with our methods of simplifying surds above, in order to rewrite surds as "like surds". For example:
$$\begin{array}{l c l}{{\sqrt{12}\,-\sqrt{3\,}}}&{{=}}&{{\sqrt{4\times3\,}\,-\sqrt{3\,}}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\sqrt{4\,}\times\sqrt{3\,}\,-\sqrt{3\,}}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{2\sqrt{3\,}-\sqrt{3\,}}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\sqrt{3\,}}}\end{array}$$
So in order to determine whether two surds can be added or subtracted, it is usually best to **simplify all surds first**.
# Rationalising the Denominator
Just as we like to present our final surd answers in fully simplified form, it is conventional to write fractions without any surds in the denominator. Another way of saying this is that we want to have a **rational denominator**.

If an expression contains a fraction with a surd in the denominator, we can use a technique to rewrite the fraction without any surds in the denominator. This technique is known as rationalising the denominator.

For fractions with a single term in the denominator, we can easily make the denominator rational by multiplying by the surd. To keep the fraction equivalent, we must also multiply the numerator by this same surd.

Sometimes there are questions when you get two or more terms in the denominator which needs to be solved by using the two squares identity and the fact that squaring a surd makes it rational. It has the the form:
$$\left(a-b\right)\left(a+b\right)=a^{2}-b^{2}$$
Notice that on the left of this identity is an expression with two terms, multiplied by another expression with the same two terms separated by the opposite sign, and the result on the right has only square terms.

If the denominator is of a term $\sqrt{ a }+b$, the **conjugate** would be $\sqrt{ a }-b$. 

Example 1:
$$\begin{array}{r l r l}{{\frac{5}{{\sqrt{6\,}}\,-1}}\,\times\,{\frac{{\sqrt{6\,}}\,+1}{{\sqrt{6\,}}\,+1}}}&{{}={}}&{{}{\frac{5{\bigl(}{\sqrt{6\,}}\,+1{\bigr)}}{{\bigl(}{\sqrt{6\,}}\,-1{\bigr)}{\bigl(}{\sqrt{6\,}}\,+1{\bigr)}}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}={}}&{{}{\frac{5{\sqrt{6\,}}\,+5}{6-1}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}={}}&{{}{\frac{5{\sqrt{6\,}}\,+5}{5}}}\end{array}$$
This can be carried further by simplifying between the numerator and the denominator
$$\begin{array}{r l r}{{\frac{5{\sqrt{6\,}}+5}{5}}}&{{}={}}&{{\frac{5\left({\sqrt{6\,}}+1\right)}{5}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{={}}}&{{{\sqrt{6\,}}+1}}\end{array}$$

> [!Summary] Surds Summary
> - To rationalise a denominator that has a single term, multiply numerator and denominator by the surd part of the denominator.
> - To rationalise a denominator that has two terms, multiply numerator and denominator by the **conjugate** of the denominator.
