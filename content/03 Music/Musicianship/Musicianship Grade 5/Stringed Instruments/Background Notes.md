The Orchestra is made up of four groups of instruments - strings, woodwind, brass and percussion. The string section consists of Violins, divided into firsts and seconds, Violas, Violoncellos and Double Basses. The normal layout of the music for the string section is in four part harmony. The strings can provide the most expressive medium in the whole range of music - and degree of nuance is possible from the softest pianissimo to the most solid forte.

Contrasts of tone are also available by mechanical means -

1. The plucking of the strings (*pizzicato*)
2. The *ponticello tremolo* (bowing the strings nearer to the bridge)
3. use of the mute (*con sordino*), a small clamp fitted over the bridge
4. *col legno* (strings are struck with the back of the bow)
5. *double notes* and *chords* can be played in freedom and variety. (Double stopping means stopping and bowing two strings at one time; also means when one or both of the strings is open)
6. lute-like *harmonic* notes are possible. By lightly touching a stretched string in its center or at a third of its length, the note an octave above, or an octave-plus-a-fifth above, can be obtained. The touch of the finger prevents the vibration of the whole but permits the vibration of the parts, thus the low note is in abeyance while the harmonic is obtainable.

Few instruments used  before 1600 are commonly used today. The Viol family was replaced by the Violin family late in the 17th century. The earliest stringed instruments were used witout a bow, tehe strings being plucked. It is not known exactly when the first Violin was made but the first accredited maker was Bertolotti. Amati was the founder of the Cremona school, and he and his two song produced remarkable instruments. The greatest of all Violin makers was Stradivari, who in his lifetime made of 1000 instruments. His work has never been equaled. Several Italian centers - Naples, Venice, Florence and Rome, had famous makers and fine instrument makers. The French were excellent bow-makers, the most celebrated being Tourte 0 the length and shape he created have been retained ever since.

The strings form the backbone of the Orchestra - great masterpieces have been written for soloists and for the String Quartet (made up of first and second Violin, Viola and Cello). in an orchestral work, the strings are almost continuously in operation. The First and Second Violins play in close harmony, the Violas play a similar part on lower harmony notes and the Cellos and Double Basses share a bass part which provides a rhythmical foundation. The Violin is the most important instrument of the Orchestra. The leader of the first violins is called the leader of the Orchestra, or Concertmaster, and ranks next in importance to the Conductor.
