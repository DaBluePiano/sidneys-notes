The Viola is played in the same way as the Violin. It is held under the chin and played with a bow. It is about a fifth larger than the Violin and has s lightly richer tone. Not quite as sparkling in tone, it is, however, an essential part of the String Quartet and fills in the gap between Violin and Cello range. Compared with the brightly voiced Violin, the sound of the Viola is veiled and often sad but has a richness of tone which is uniquely beautiful. Viola playing has been a somewhat neglected art. 18th Century composers made the Violas simply double the Cellos and Basses, and it was one of the reforms of Stamitz (who exercised an immense influence on the standard of orchestral playing and the composition of the Symphony to give it an immense influence on the standard of orchestral playing and the composition of the Symphony) to give it an independent part. Not a great deal of original composition has been written for the Viola. The Englishman, Tertis, was an enthusiast for the Viola and carried its playing to tremendous heights. He re-arranged some Violin compositions for it, and persuaded some living composers to write special work for Viola. Hindemith was himself a great virtuoso of the instrument. The strings are thicker than the Violin strings and are pitched a perfect fifth lower. The music for the Viola is written mainly in the **ALTO** clef, which has Middle C on the third line; the treble clef is used for the higher notes. The alto clef is best suited to the compass of the instrument.
