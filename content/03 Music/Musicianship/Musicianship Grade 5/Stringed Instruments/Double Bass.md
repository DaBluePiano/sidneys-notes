title: Double Bass
---

The Double Bass is the largest member of the string family. In shape, it is the one that shows most clearly the ancestry of the viol. It is so large that the player must stand, or sit on a high stool to play it. The four strings, which are quite thick and heavy, are tuned in perfect FOURTHS. The notation of the Double Bass, in order to avoid excessive use of leger lines, shows the music an octave higher than it actually sounds.

The Double Bass provides the rhythmic foundation of the Orchestra and the deep tonal colouring essential to the music. The Orchestra would sound very thing without its Double Basses. In an Orchestra, the Double Bass often doubles the Cello part an octave lower, but sometimes has an independent part. It is played pizzicato far more than the other stringer instruments, especially in jazz groups and dance bands. A special effect is produced by slapping the strings. Technique and construction of the double Bass are similar to the Cello and the player can manipulate passages of agility. Brilliant tones can be obtained from the in instrument. Dragonetti, Botessini and Koussevitsky were virtuosic Double Bass. The Double bass repertory is small. A curiosity is Dubensky's Fugue for 10 Double Basses. Van Dieren wrote a very difficult String Quartet with Double Bass instead of cello. Stravinsky's ballet *Rite of Spring* contains passages for up to 6 separate Double Bass parts. Schubert's Octet also uses the Double Bass.
