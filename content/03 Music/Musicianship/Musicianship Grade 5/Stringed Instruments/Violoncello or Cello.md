title: Violoncello or Cello

The Cello is a much larger instrument than the Violin, midway in size between the Viola and the Double Bass. It might be considered the baritone of the string section. The instrument is rested on the floor on a metal peg and the player sits to play, holding the Cello between his knees. The metal peg, or spike, slides up inside the instrument when not in use. Th development of Cello playing has followed a similar path to that of Violin playing. Among famous cellists who have contributed to it are Duport, Romberg, Servais, Piatti and Popper.

The Cello has a beautifully rich tone, is not as agile as Violin but is still capable of remarkable virtuosity. It is charming in its warm and melancholy tones. Composers have been greatly attracted to it and a great deal of music has been written for it. It was a popular solo instrument in Beethoven's time. Since then, remarkable players like Pablo Casals have made it a very popular instrument. The direct ancestor of the Cello was the Viola da gamba. The parts of the instruments from the top down are:

- **Scroll
- **Tuning** **Pegs**
- **Neck**
- **Fingerboard**
- **Strings**
- **Ribs**
- **Sound** **Holes**
- **Bridge**
- **Belly**
- **Tailpiece**

the construction is the same as for Violin.

Basically the technique is similar to that of the Violin, and it has a large compss. The four strings are tuned an octave lower than those of the Viola. The Cello part is normally written in the bass clef, wupper notes in the tenor clef (having Middle C on the fourth line) and the highest notes in the treble clef.
