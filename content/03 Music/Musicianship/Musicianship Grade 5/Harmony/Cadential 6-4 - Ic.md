As its name implies, this chord may only be used in a cadence and must be followed by chord V on the same bass note. It occurs on the strong beat of the bar (except in troiple time when it may be placed on the 2nd beat of the bar).

Ic may be used in 3 Cadences:

Perfect Imperfect and Interrupted

The 6th falls to the 5th

The 4th falls to the 3rd

The bass note is doubled in Ic and V
