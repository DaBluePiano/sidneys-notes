> The 3 primary triads are 1 (tonic), IV (subdominant), and V (dominant). In a major key, they are all major triads.

The **root** note of each of these triads is **doubled** to form the necessary 4 note chords.

> I<sup>b</sup> is the second inversion of the I chord
> I<sup>c</sup> is the third inversion of the I chord

The root of the chord is placed in the bass voice-apart with the stem **down**. The other 3 notes of the chord may be placed (in any order) in the Tenor, Alto and Soprano. Notice also the position of the stems. The upper 3 notes of a chord may be placed in any order, providing there is not more than an octave between upper voices (ie., between Soprano and Alto and Alto and Tenor) It is possible to have more than an octave between Tenor and bass.

In a minor key, chords I and IV are minor triads. A minor triad consists of a root plus its minor 3rd and perfect 5th above. Chord V is a major triad in a minor key because the 8th note, or leading note, must be raised and chord V contains the leading note as the major 3rd.

> NEVER forget to raise the 7th note in chord V in a minor key.
