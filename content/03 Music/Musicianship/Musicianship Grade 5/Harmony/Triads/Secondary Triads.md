title: Secondary Triads
---
In a major key, II, III and VI and in a minor key VI, are called **Secondary Triads**. These chords have much more freedom in doubling than the Primary Triads. Chords II and VI in major and VI in minor may have the **root** doubled or **3rd** doubled or **5th** doubled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The root double is usually satisfactory, but when the progression V-VI is used (an Iinterrupted Cadence), the 3rd in chord VI MUST be doubled.
