Second Inversion Chords are available in chords I, IV and V. A second inversion chord is composed by placing he 5th of the chord in the bass-part and the root and the 3rd of the chord in upper voices.

It is called a <sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub> chord because the intervals above the bass note are a 6th and a 4th.

YOU MUST double the bass note.

> [!Example]
> Root chord is C E **G** C, therefore the second inversion is **G** C E **G**

Letter 'c' represents a 2nd inversion chord.

Ic may be used as a Cadential <sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub> and as a Passing <sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub> between IV and IVb.

Vc may only be used as a Passing <sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub> between I and Ib.

Second inversion chords must be strictly used, and followed by certain chords. They may NOT be used in a harmony exercise simply to fill an empty place in the exercise.
