1. **Don't** leap a 7th
2. **Don't** leap to or from the leading note
3. **Do** cover the LN at all time - 8**7**6 or 6**7**8. Use it only in scale passages
4. **Don't** ever double the LN
5. **Don't** in the 2 part section, use the intervals 2, 4 or 7 on main beats
6. **Don't** have exposed (or hidden) 5ths or octaves (If the melody line (soprano voice) leaps in one direction make sure that the bass part does not move in a similar motion to a 5th or octave.)
7. **Do** see if a <sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub> is possible in the first bar
8. **Do** watch note values
9. **Do** make sure that your added passing notes do not cause errors
10. **Don't** cross parts or overlap
