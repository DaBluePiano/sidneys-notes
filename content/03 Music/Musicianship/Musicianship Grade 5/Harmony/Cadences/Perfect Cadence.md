title: Perfect Cadence
---
The most important of the 4 cadences. It is used to end almost every musical composition and is the cadence used in modulation. A few basic rules will ensure accuracy in composing. 

> [!Rules]
> 1. Place roots first in the bass part.
> 2. Build chord V. The 3 upper notes may be in any order in the 3 voices.
> 3. LN must rise to tonic.
> 4. Note in common in the 2 chords remains in the same voice.
> 5. Complete chord I (the other part steps up)

> [!Remember]
> A Perfect Cadence is very simple to compose: 2⬆️, 1▶️

> [!Caution]
> In a minor key, don't forget to raise the 7th note which appears in chord V

In the test, the bass part may be given - it is a simple matter to add the upper parts. Sometimes, however the melody line is given and a Perfect Cadence must be composed below this line. If the final note given is the tonic note, then the **5th note of chord I must be omitted**.
