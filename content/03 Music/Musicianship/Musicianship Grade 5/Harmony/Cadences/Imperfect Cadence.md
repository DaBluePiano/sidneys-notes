title: Imperfect Cadence
---

The Imperfect Cadence is used as a half-close or a cadence half way through a musical sentence. It always ends with chord V but many different chords may be used to precede chord V. For example, an Imperfect Cadence may be I-V, Ib-V, II-V, IIb-V, IV-V, IVb-V, VI-V. The most satisfactory Imperfect Cadence is IIb-V. When writing an Imperfect Cadence, always remember to move to the **nearest** notes and keep a **common** note in the same voice-part.

> [!Caution]
> Avoid large leaps. If you compose IV-V or VI-V you must move the upper parts in contrary motion to the bass. II-V is unavailable in minor keys because II is a diminished triad and problems occur between the 6th and 7th degrees of the scale. Use IIb-V in a minor key. Do not use Vi-V in a minor key either, as problems also rise between 6th and 7th degrees.

Remember to raise the 7th note in a minor key but do not leap and augmented 2nd from the 6th to 7th degree.
