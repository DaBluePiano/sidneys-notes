title: Two-Part Writing

A crotchet bass part is given and you must write a musicall interesting melody above the bass.

The first step is to think in terms of Harmony and build a chord structure on the crotchet bass.

Write the triad notes of I, II, IV, V and VI at the side of the exercise. Fit the given bass notes to the chord. Look for cadence points **first**.

From each chord take one note to form part of the melody line. As you proceed with the composing, try to make an interesting line. Avoid repeated notes which tend to hold up the flow of the music. A 5th is rather bare at the beginning and the end; avoid it. Consecutive 5ths and octaves are not allowed (and hidden consecutives), and not more than three 3rds or three 6ths should be used in a row. The marking of intervals through the 'middle' of the staves will help you to avoid errors. You still must observe rules of harmony (e.g., in V-VI, when 3rd is doubled in chord VI, you can't write another root note; you must write a 3rd or a 5th). [[Unaccented Passing Notes and Auxiliary Notes (Neighbour Notes)|Passing notes]] and [[Auxiliary Note or Neighbour Notes|auxiliary notes]] may be added for further interest. You may move to another note of the same chord - [[Bye-Tone (Consonant Skip)|bye-toning]].

3, 5, 6, 8 may be used on crotchet beats. 2, 4, 7 should only be used as passing notes. The bass and melody should be not more than 2 octaves apart.
