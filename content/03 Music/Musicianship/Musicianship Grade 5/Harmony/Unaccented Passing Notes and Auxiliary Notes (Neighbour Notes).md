title: Unaccented Passing Notes and Auxiliary Notes (Neighbour Notes)
---
When harmony notes in nany voice are a 3rd apart, an unaccented passing note may be used to link the 2 notes.
The unessential note must not cause consecutive 5ths and you must not quite a 2nd by similar motion.
Two parts may move in parallel 3rds and 6ths with passing notes. Two parts may use the same passing note in contrary motion. ALWAYS add passing notes carefully.
In a minor key you must take care with the 6th and 7th degrees. Lower the 7th desecnding and raise the 6th and 7th ascending. (Melodic form)
