## Art Song - France
France was slow in developing compositions for the solo singer. However, a demand for songs came with the French revolution - such as song as *La Marseillaise*. Many 19th century composers began writing songs. Berlioz's song cycle *Summer Nights* has an accompaniment for Piano or Orchestra. Faur√© set nine love poems by Verlaine in his cycle *The Good Song*. In Debussy's 59 songs, including the *Chansons de Bilitis* 1897, the Piano emphasises the contours of the poem. Milhaud and Poulenc have also made important contributions to the field of an Art song.

Their songs present a remarkable variety of moods and styles. Other important Russian composers of this form were Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev and Stravinsky.
