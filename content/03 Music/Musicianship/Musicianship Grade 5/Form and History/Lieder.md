> [!Definition]
> The word *Lied* is German for *Song*, and it's the name applied to the Austrian and German compositions in which the vocal line and the Piano accompaniment are of equal importance. 

17th Century Lieder were *Continuo* Lieder. That is, the accompaniment was a *Basso Continuo* (Figured Bass). With the rise of the opera came extended virtuoso songs and concert arias, which reached a peak in the works of Haydn and Mozart. Both of these composers wrote some charming Lieder (Mozart's *Das Veilchen*, to words by Goethe, stand with the best of Schubert). Beethoven wrote 79 Lieder , but he and other classical composers gave the musical aspect of the Lied more prominence than the literary aspect. For Beethoven, the composition of Lieder was a means of self-expression, irrespective of the literary merit. Examples of Beethoven include the song cycle *An die ferne Geliebte* and the charming Lied, *Adelaide*. 

The Romantic Movement of the early 19th Century had a great effect upon the evolution of song. The rise of the great German Romantic poetry was an important factor in the development of the Lied, and the rise of the Piano in the early 19th Century, which its increased sonority over earlier keyboard instruments, provided an adequate support for the solo voice. The relative perfection and universal popularity of the Piano, together with the lyrical poems of Goethe and Heine in particular, blended together to be a great source of inspirationto the composers.

## Schubert *(1797-1828)*
Schubert's Lieder are the heart and soul of the entire Lieder literature. As a Lieder composer, Schubert's stature is so overwhelming that he stand that the head of all the distinguished composers of this form. The essential features of his Lieder are their romantic feeling for nature and their wealth of emotion, in the individual songs as well as in song cycles, such as *Die Schöne Müllerin* where an idyllic opening is gradually clouded by bitterness and resignation. The infinitely moving 'Winterreise' runs the whole gamut of melancholy and yearning, from despair to hopelessness; there is the masterly maturity of *Schwanengsang*, and brilliant settings of poems by Heine ranks alongside Schubert's earlier setting of Goethe such as *Gretchen at the Spinning Wheel* and *The Earl-King*. Schubert wrote about 600 Lieder of an almost infinite variety, from the most elementary strophic song to complete settings. Some have simple accompaniments, others are highly elaborate and difficult to perform, with remarkable harmonies and striking modulations. Some are lyrical, some are in tensely dramatic, all with the Piano accompaniment asserting itself as an equal partner. 

Schumann, Frana, Brahms and Hugo Wolf are other great names in the history of the German Lied.

## Schumann (1810-1856)
His approach to literature and music was essneitally romantic. He set some of the finest Romantic poetry to equally fine mu sic. Sometimes the Piano accompaniment has more importance than the melody of the song, and some lack the dramatic quality fo Schubert's Lieder. some of his first songs are in the two song cycles *Dicheterliebe* and *Frauenliebe und -Leben*. He is best in settings of Heine poems.
## Franz (1815-1892)
He composed some 250 songs. He did not possess Schubert's dramatic power but had a fine feeling for melody. He limited his songs to subjects of extreme emotion and wrote only for the mezzo-sompano voice. 
## Brahms (1833-1897)
He added his own incomparable tone colour to the art of lieder writing. His approach to the words of a song was musical rather than literary. His accompaniments are serious in style and protray the mood of the poem by means of Romantic harmony. Examples - *Magelone*, the extensive *Four Serious Songs*, *Wiegenlied* and *Sandmännchen*
## Hugo Wolf (1860-1903)
wolf was almost exclusively a song composer and he rounded off the development of the 19th Century Lied. He was a great admirer of Wagner and put into practice Wagner's stipulation that a song should be as inseparable from the words as from the melody. He gave scrupulous attention to literary details. Furthermore, he steeped himself in the spirit of the poem, wholly identifying himself with it and so extracting from it the very essence of its being. His Lieder settings have amazing beauty of melodiousness and are a perfect marriage of words and music. For example, *Do you know the Land* faithfully reflects Goethe's poem.
## 20th Century Composers
Max Reger continues late 19th Century lines. Mahler, Schoenberg, Webern andn Berg have writtten fine Lieder, eg. Mahler's *Songs of a Wayfarer* and *The Youth's Magic Horn*; Schoenberg's *Book of the Hanging Gardens* and his 12-tone *Drei Lieder*; Webern's highly contrapuntal chamber songs Op 13-19; Berg-s *Alternberg* Lieder,
