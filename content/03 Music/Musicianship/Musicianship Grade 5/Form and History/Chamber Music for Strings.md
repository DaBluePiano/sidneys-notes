title: Chamber Music for Strings
---
Chamber music originally meant music which was performed in a 'room' rather than a Concert Hall. It is instrumental ensemble music performed by **one player for each part**, as opposed to orchestral music in which there are are several players for each apt. Chamber music can be written for a **Trio (3), Quartet (4), Quintet (5), Sextet (6), Septet (7) or Octet (8)**. String Trios and String Quartets are for stringed instruments only. (Trio - Violin, Viola Cello; Quartet - Violin 1, Violin 2, Viola and Cello). If another instrument is included it is called, for example, Piano Trio (Piano and 2 strings) or Clarinet Quintet (Clarinet and 4 strings). in chamber music the emphasis lies more on the **ensemble** than on the individual players.

At the beginning of the 17th century, instrumental music was developing independently, expanding both in range and technique. English music of this period shows the process of emancipation from the vocal madrigal style. Fantasias in fugal style were derived from the madrigal and early composers of these Fantasias included Byrd and Gibbons. Jenkins evolved a more truly instrumental style in his compositions. The Italian composer, **Corelli**, was one of the first to explore the possibilities of the Violin, which had superseded the Viol, Chand his Sonatas were among the earliest examples of instrumental Chamber music. Bach and HÃ¤ndel wrote Chamber music in which the parts of more equal importance, through a *Continuo*, generally a Harpsichord, was always needed to fill in the harmonies. The harpsichordist, counted on for support by filling in these harmonies, played his so-called *Continuo* from the bass part only, with figures beneath the notes to indicate the harmonies required (a **figured bass**).  The Baroque Chamber work usually consisted of 2 Violins, String Bass and Harpsichord *Continuo*.

Haydn's earliest Chamber music works had a keyboard Continuo which he gradually discarded. Probably one of his greatest achievements was the establishment of the String Quartet as a permanent art work, a form that is regarded as the most perfect musical medium. Haydn was not the inventor of the String Quartet but the **establisher**, and his title *Father of Instrumental Music* is a tribute to his genius in this branch of the art. CPE Bach's Sonatas, which influenced Haydn in the composition of his string quartets, consisted of three movements, quick, slow, quick, none of them being dance movements. Haydn was fond of the Minuet Form, however, so he began to add it to his chamber and orchestral works, completing the **String Quartet Form** as we know it today - **1st Movement** Allegro in Sonata form, **2nd Movement** usually slow, **3rd Movement**, Minuet and Trio, **4th Movement**, fast - Sonata-Rondo form.

The string quartets of Haydn and Mozart established the style and form to which composers to the present day have adhered - the style is individual part writing but without virtuosic elements, and the form is that of a Sonata or Symphony in 4 movements. In chamber music, composers have largely kept to traditions without introducing novel features. **Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven** and **Schubert** are the great **Classical Masters** of chamber music. 

## Haydn
Haydn wrote altogether 83 string quartets, at first composing six at a time and late three at a time. The first great quartets are seen in Op 20. By Op 33 - *Russian* Quartets - Haydn is beginning to give each part a true contrapuntal nature, even introducing a fugue with two subjects - thus liberating the Cello from a mere bass line and making it an independent instrument. By Op 54, Haydn commences to write three quartets at a time.



## Mozart
Mozart explored these effects of scoring
