Mozart's String Quartet in G major, K 387, was the first of a set of six quartets composed in Vienna between 1782 and 1785 and which he published as Op. 10, with a dedication to Joseph Haydn (hence the six, as a group, are often called the 'Haydn Quartets'). The dedication is quite significant, because these quartets were composed in response to Haydn's influential and landmark Op. 33 set, which Mozart studied closely and whose level of compositional craft he sought to emulate. Haydn himself heard the quartets in 1785, and it was these works in particular that prompted his famous remark to Mozart's father, Leopold, who was visiting from Salzburg: 'Before God, and as an honest man, I tell you that your son is the greatest composer known to me either in person or by name. He has taste, and, what is more, the most profound knowledge of composition'.
