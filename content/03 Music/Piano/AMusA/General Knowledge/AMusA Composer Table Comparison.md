Despite his brilliance, Debussy often clashed with the Conservatoire's conservative professors due to his unconventional ideas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Middle Life**                      | 1. **Weimar (1708–1717)**: Bach worked as a court organist and later as ==concertmaster== for the Duke of Weimar. During this time, he composed many of his famous organ works and cantatas. He also studied and adapted Italian styles, particularly Vivaldi's concertos, which influenced his compositions.<br>    <br>2. **Köthen (1717–1723)**: Bach served as Kapellmeister (music director) for Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Köthen. The prince, a Calvinist, preferred secular music, so Bach focused on instrumental works. This period saw the creation of masterpieces like the Brandenburg Concertos, the Well-Tempered Clavier (Book 1), and the Cello Suites.<br>    <br>3. **Leipzig (1723–1750)**: Bach became the Thomaskantor (music director, Cantor at St Thomas) at St. Thomas Church and School. His responsibilities included composing and performing church music, teaching, and directing choirs. He wrote monumental works like the St. Matthew Passion, the Mass in B Minor, and numerous cantatas. Leipzig was his longest and most productive period.                                                                                                                                                                                    | Mozart entered the service of the ==Archbishop== in 1769, but was treated poorly, with ==disagreements==. He continued to travel, including several visits to ==Italy, Germany and France==. He finally left the Archbishop in 1781, settling in Vienna, where he hoped to find a new job.<br><br>Vienna was one of the main musical centres of Europe, and Mozart met many prominent composers there, including Haydn, Clementi. He married ==Constanze Weber== in 1782, and they had six children, but only two survived infancy. Mozart earned a modest income from ==teaching== and ==performing==.<br><br>In 1785, Mozart began work on operas such as *Le nozze di Figaro (The marriage of Figaro)* with the Italian poet Lorenzo da Ponte. In 1784-6 he composed nine of the greatest piano concertos in literature. | In ==1829==, at the age of 20, Mendelssohn ==conducted the first performance of the *St Matthew Passion* since Bach's death.== Mendelssohn was one of the key contributors to Bach's fame today.<br><br>In the 1830s he ==toured== widely, being particularly ==well received in England==, where he was a favourite of Queen Victoria. Mendelssohn later became ==conductor== of the ==Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra==, and was a ==founder== and ==director== of the ==Conservatory== there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | He won the prestigious ==Prix de Rome== in 1884 with cantata which allowed him to study in ==Rome==. However, he found the experience stifling and returned to Paris. During this period, he was influenced by Russian composers like ==Mussorgsky== and the exotic sounds of the Javanese gamelan.<br>In 1902, Debussy achieved international fame with his opera *Pelléas et Mélisande*, which showcased his unique approach to musical storytelling. Throughout his career, he composed a wide range of works, including piano pieces, orchestral compositions, and chamber music. |
| **Late Life**                        | Bach's health began to decline, partly due to complications from a failed eye surgery. He passed away in Leipzig on July 28, 1750, at the age of 65.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | In 1787 he was appointed to the job of *Kammermusicus* (chamber musician) by Emperor Joseph II.

Characteristics of Bach's compositions include:<br><br>- ==counterpoint== (two or more equally important voices heard simultaneously).<br>- ==ornamentation== and embellishment (e.g. trills), particularly at cadence points.<br>- ==imitation== between the voices.<br>- many ==sequences==, sometimes based on *circle of 5ths* harmonic progressions.<br>- ==modulations== to closely related keys (typically up or down a 5th).<br>- ==monothematic== form (one main theme per movement).<br>- long ==phrases==.<br>- steady ==rhythmic pulse==.<br>- ==hemiola== rhythm before some important cadence points.<br>- ==tierce de Picardie== endings for works in minor keys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Mozart was one of the leading representatives of the Classical style (c.1750-c.1810), which is usually light and elegant, characterised by:<br><br>- ==short, balanced phrases== (antecedent and consequent, or question and answer).<br>- ==homophony== (one melodic line, with simple chordal or broken chord accompaniments).<br>- predominantly ==diatonic harmonies==, often based on the primary triads (I, IV, V7).<br>- modulations to ==closely related keys==, typically up or down a 5th.<br>- ==steady== (though not rigid) ==pulse==.<br>- clearly articulated sound, with many ==detached notes== and ==short slurs==.<br>- ==ornamentation==, particularly at cadence points.<br>- ==thematic development== and highly-organised ==formal== structure<br>- ==syncopation==                                   | Mendelssohn's music is ==elegant== and charming; ==in== this respect, and in his fondness of ==classical== formal structures, he was ==more 'classical'== than Schumann or Chopin, who were born one year late. The ==lyricism== of his melodies and chromaticism (albeit restrained) of his ==harmonies== are '==romantic==' characteristics of his style. Foremost among the forms at which he ==excelled== was the ==Scherzo==, such as that from *A Midsummer Night's Dream*.<br><br><br>Romantic characteristics of the piece include:<br><br>- highly ==expressive== character with frequent ==changes of mood==<br>- ==lyrical== melodies<br>- ==rich harmonies== using ==chromaticism==<br>- sparkling ==virtuosity==<br> | Debussy's musical style has an affinity with two other characteristically French genres - the *impressionist* painters (eg. Monet, Manet and Degas) and the *symbolist* writers (eg. Verlaine and Mallarmé). The label 'impressionist' is the one most commonly applied to Debussy's music (in spite of the fact that the composer himself objected to it).<br><br>Some characteristics of the piece were:<br>- Frequent use of ==7th and 9th chords==<br>- ==Parallel== movement of chords<br>- ==Pedal== points<br>- Rhythmic ==fluidity==<br>                                      |
