# Composer

## Bio

Johann Sebastian Bach was a German composer and organist from the late Baroque period. He was born into a family of musicians in Eisenach (northern Germany) in 1685. Bach received early training in the violin and organ from his father and his older brother, Johann Christoph. At the age of 15 he became a paid chorister at St Michael's church in Lüneburg, followed by various other positions as violinist and organist.

In 1708, Bach was appointed court organist to the Duke of Weimar. He later became concertmaster of the court orchestra as well. Bach composed many of his great organ works, as well as cantatas and other instrumental music, at this time.

In 1717 he became Kapellmeister (director of music) to the Prince of Cöthen. Prince Leopold was a keen amateur musician who played the viola da gamba, and he maintained a fine orchestra of around 18 members for his own entertainment and the esteem of his court. Bach wrote many of his great instrumental works specifically for these musicians. Bach's first wife, Maria Barbara, died in 1720, and the following year he married Anna Magdalena.

From 1723 until his death, Bach was Cantor (singing master) at St Thomas' Church, Leipzig. This church had a well established and quite elaborate instrumental and choral tradition; in his first few years there he wrote an astounding number of new cantatas for use in the church services - sometimes as frequently as one each week. His eyesight deteriorated in the final years of his life, and he died in Leipzig in 1750, at the age of 65.

Bach was an unrivalled master of counterpoint, and a lot of his music is highly complex. Throughout his life, he was appreciated more for his brilliant organ playing and improvisatory skill than for his compositions. By the end of his life, his music was regarded as old- fashioned, as a simpler, more superficially elegant (galant) style was in vogue.

## Compositional Style

Music from the late Baroque period (c. 1600-c.1750) is often elaborate and complex. Characteristics of Bach's compositions include:

• counterpoint (two or more equally important voices heard simultaneously).

• ornamentation and embellishment (e.g. trills), particularly at cadence points.

• imitation between the voices.

• many sequences, sometimes based on "circle of 5ths" harmonic progressions.

• modulations to closely related keys (typically up or down a 5th).

• monothematic form (one main theme per movement).

• long phrases.

• steady rhythmic pulse.

• hemiola rhythm before some important cadence points.

• tierce de Picardie endings for works in minor keys.

# Piece

Toccata in E minor BWV 914

A toccata is a piece for a keyboard instrument. The name comes from an Italian word meaning "to touch". Toccatas are pieces that display the performer's touch, or allow the performer to test an instrument's touch. Bach would sometimes improvise a toccata when trying out a new organ or harpsichord. Earlier composers of toccatas include Frescobaldi, Froberger, Buxtehude and Alessandro Scarlatti.

Bach wrote five toccatas for organ during his time at Weimar, or possibly earlier, including the famous Toccata and fugue in D minor, BWV 565. He also composed seven toccatas for harpsichord around this time. Bach's toccatas usually contain a combination of rhapsodic (quasi-improvisatory) and contrapuntal (fugal) passages, although some of his toccatas contain greater rhythmic regularity, typically using continuous semiquavers. The latter moto perpetuo style (associated with some 18th Century Italian composers of toccatas, such as Domenico Scarlatti, his pupil Carlos Seixas, and Domenico Paradies) became the model for most toccatas written during the 19th and 20th Centuries.

The Toccata BWV 914 contains four movements, all in the same key. The outer movements are in a moto perpetuo style, using continuous quavers or semiquavers. The second and fourth movements are fugal, while the third movement is lyrical and improvisatory. All four movements demonstrate various aspects of touch, namely agility, cantabile tone and contrapuntal layering.

## I. *No Tempo Marking*

The opening movement has the character of an improvisation, with a through-composed formal structure and a continuous quaver pulse.

1-3

	The opening statement establishes the key of **E minor**. Each bar begins with tonic harmony, approached by dominant 7th harmony at the ends of bar 1 and 2. The left hand embellishes a tonic pedal with a lower neighbour note and an octave leap. 

	The answering right hand figure forms the main melodic motive of the movement, imitating then extending the left hand's lower neighbour note group. It contains a falling 4th and rising 3rd, but othervvise moves by step, beginning and ending with a lower neighbour note group (B-A-B and G-F#-G). 

3-6

	The main motive is used in a rising sequence, outlining a iv-V-i progression in E minor. Each chord is heard on the main beat of bars 4-6, respectively, and is approached by its dominant 7th at the end of the previous bar. 

6-13

	The closing passage begins with another sequence, still beginning with a lower neighbour note group, but now using a falling 5th and rising 4th, with an increase in textural density. There is extended dominant-tonic movement in the bass from b.9, forming a V-1 cadence in b. 10-11, with a further increase in textural density. The tonic chord contains a tierce de Picardie (i.e. in b. 1 1, and is extended throughout b. 11-13. There is a final reference to the main motive in each hand in b. 12-13.

## II. *Un Poco Allegro*

This movement is a double fugue in four voices. The two subjects are introduced by pair of voices. Due to its brevity, the movement could be referred to as a *fugato*.

14-16

	Subject 1 is introduced by the tenor, in counterpoint with Subject 2 in the alto, in **E minor**. Both themes begin on the dominant note. Subject 1 contains a distinctive rhythm and some wide leaps (falling 5th and rising 8ve), ending on the tonic note at the start of b.3. Subject 2 moves entirely by step, often using a `quaver semiquaver x2` rhythmic motive. The longer notes often form suspensions (e.g. 1st beat of b. 15)

	The short codetta in b.16 modulates to B minor, using a transposition of part of Subject 1 (originally heard at the end of b.14 and start of b.15).

16-18

	Subject 1 is restated by the bass (beginning on the last beat of b.16) in **B minor** (the dominant key), with Subject 2 in the soprano and free counterpoint in the other voices. This passage forms a "real answer", since both subjects have been transposed without alteration into the dominant key.

19-22

	Episode 1, in three voices (the tenor is absent). The upper voices are in dialogue. The bass contains rising semitones in b.19, then outlines a circle of 5ths progression in b.20-21 (E-A-D-G), bringing passing hints of A minor and G major. Bar 22 returns to E minor, with rhythmic motives from both subjects heard in the upper voices.

23-25

	Subject 1 returns in the soprano in **E minor**, with Subject 2 in the tenor and free counterpoint in the other voices.

25-27

	Subject 1 returns in the alto in **A minor** (the subdominant key), with Subject 2 in the soprano and free counterpoint in the other voices.

27-28

	Episode 2, in three voices (the bass is absent), returning to E minor. The upper voices are in dialogue in b.27, using a semiquaver motive from b.19, above broken octaves in the tenor. Bar 28 contains rhythmic or melodic motives from both subjects.

29-30

	Subject 1 returns in the bass in **E minor** (omitting the final note), with Subject 2 in the tenor. The soprano is absent. The alto is in dialogue with the tenor in b.29, and these voices mostly move in 3rds in b.30.

31-33

	Episode 3. The tenor extends Subject 2 in b.31, with the alto continuing to move mostly in 3rds with the tenor, and free counterpoint in the bass. The alto and tenor reverse roles in b.32-33 (i.e. the alto has the start of Subject 2, answered in dialogue by the tenor).

33-35

	Subject 1 returns in the soprano (beginning at the end of b.33) in **B minor**, with Subject 2 in the tenor and free counterpoint in the other voices.

35-37

	Episode 4, recalling b.19-20, transposed down a 4th and rhythmically displaced by half a bar, returning to E minor. There is strong dominant-tonic movement in the bass in b.36-37, but the resulting cadence is a type of interrupted progression, delaying harmonic closure by avoiding the tonic chord.

37-39

	Subject 1 returns in the alto in **E minor**, with Subject 2 in the soprano. The lower voices are mostly absent.

38-41

	Subject 1 partially returns in the bass in E minor, slightly overlapping the previous alto entry, with Subject 2 in the tenor. There is another strong dominant-tonic movement in the bass in b.39-41, but the full arrival of the tonic chord (including tierce de Picardie) is not heard until b.41.

*Un poco Allegro* means moderately fast

## III. Adagio

This lyrical movement has the character of an improvisation, with a through-composed formal structure and few internal cadence points. The tonality never completely leaves the realm of E minor, since the other keys used are not fully established by closing cadences. The texture is predominantly arpeggiation.

42-49

	The movement begins with a languid arpeggiation of the tonic chord of E minor in semiquavers. Some of the notes are approached by their lower neighbours (F#-G, D#-E). 

	The arpeggiation continues as a single voice in b.43. By the end of this bar, the tonic chord of E minor has become the dominant 7th of A minor. 

	Bar 44 begins as a transposition of b.42 up a 4th to **A minor** (the subdominant key), followed by further arpeggiation and some scale flourishes, with demisemiquaver rhythm introduced in b.45-46. There is a dominant pedal in the bass throughout much of this passage. Imitative dialogue between the right hand voices in b.47 leads to an arpeggiation of the dominant chord of A minor in b.48, somewhat recalling b.12.

49-50

	A rhapsodic interlude, briefly moving into B minor (the dominant key), using a diminished 7th in tremolo texture in b.49, and a first inversion tonic chord in b.50, embellished with a rapid descending scale flourish.

51-54

	The opening theme is restated in E minor, with some harmonic variation (becoming VI7 in the second half of b.51). The rhythm becomes more florid again in b.52-53, leading to an arpeggiation of the dominant chord at the end of b.53.
