# Bach

1. **Period of Music**: This piece belongs to the **Baroque period** (c. 1600–1750), characterized by elaborate ornamentation, contrast, and expressive musical forms.
2. **When in the Composer's Life It Was Composed**: It was composed around **1710**, during Bach’s early years, when he was influenced by North German keyboard traditions.
3. **Basic Overarching Characteristics of the Period**: Baroque music features **high ornamentation, complex counterpoint, contrasting dynamics, and a continuous bass line** that supports expressive melodic lines.
4. **Is the Work Part of a Larger Collection?**: Yes, it is part of **Bach’s seven keyboard toccatas (BWV 910–916)**, which were compiled posthumously but share stylistic similarities.
5. **Influences or Inspirations**: The piece reflects **North German keyboard traditions** and may have been influenced by **Italian violinistic themes**, as well as composers like **Dieterich Buxtehude**, who was known for his improvisatory keyboard works.
6. **Style and Character**: The toccata is **virtuosic and improvisatory**, featuring **dramatic contrasts, expressive passages, and intricate fugues**.
7. **Form and Basic Key Structure**: The piece follows a **multi-sectional toccata form**, including **a prelude, fugues, and an adagio section**. It is in **E minor**, with modulations throughout.
8. **Instrument and Interpretation**: Originally composed for **harpsichord**, the piece can also be played on **piano or organ**. The harpsichord’s **plucked strings** create a crisp articulation, while the piano allows for **dynamic shaping**, affecting interpretation.

# Mozart

1. **Period of Music**: This piece belongs to the **Classical period** (c. 1750–1820), characterized by balanced phrasing, clear harmonic structures, and elegant melodies.
2. **When in the Composer's Life It Was Composed**: It was composed in **1783**, when Mozart was **27 years old**, during his early years in Vienna.
3. **Basic Overarching Characteristics of the Period**: Classical music features **clarity, balance, homophonic textures, and structured forms** like sonata and symphony. It also emphasizes **dynamic contrast and expressive phrasing**.
4. **Is the Work Part of a Larger Collection?**: Yes, it is part of **Mozart’s cycle of piano sonatas (K. 330–332)**, which were published together in **1784**.
5. **Influences or Inspirations**: The sonata reflects **Mozart’s exposure to Italian and French styles**, particularly **the galant style**, which emphasizes **graceful and lyrical melodies**.
6. **Style and Character**: The sonata is **light, elegant, and expressive**, with **graceful phrasing and dynamic contrasts**. The second movement has a **lyrical and introspective quality**, while the final movement is **playful and energetic**.
7. **Form and Basic Key Structure**: The piece follows **sonata form**, with three movements:
    - **Allegro moderato** (C major)
    - **Andante cantabile** (F major)
    - **Allegretto** (C major) The first movement modulates to **G major** in the exposition, while the second movement explores **F minor and A-flat major** before returning to F major.
8. **Instrument and Interpretation**: Originally composed for **fortepiano**, the piece can be played on **modern piano**. The fortepiano’s **lighter touch and dynamic range** influence interpretation, making articulation and phrasing crucial for an authentic performance.

# Mendelssohn

1. **Period of Music**: This piece belongs to the **Romantic period** (c. 1800–1910), characterized by expressive melodies, rich harmonies, and dramatic contrasts.
2. **When in the Composer's Life It Was Composed**: It was originally conceived in **1828** as an étude and later revised in **1830**, when Mendelssohn added an expressive Andante introduction.
3. **Basic Overarching Characteristics of the Period**: Romantic music emphasizes **individual expression, emotional depth, chromaticism, and expanded forms**. Composers sought to evoke nature, literature, and personal emotions.
4. **Is the Work Part of a Larger Collection?**: No, it is a **standalone composition**, though it was originally written as an étude before Mendelssohn expanded it into a full-fledged concert piece.
5. **Influences or Inspirations**: The piece reflects **Bach’s counterpoint**, **Mozart’s balanced phrasing**, and **Beethoven’s dramatic gestures**. It was also influenced by **Carl Maria von Weber’s harmonic transitions**, particularly in the Andante section.
6. **Style and Character**: The work is **virtuosic and expressive**, featuring **a lyrical Andante introduction followed by a brilliant Presto leggiero**. It showcases **delicate passagework, rapid arpeggios, and dramatic contrasts**.
7. **Form and Basic Key Structure**: The piece follows a **rondo form**, with an **Andante introduction in E major** leading into a **Presto leggiero in E minor**. It explores **closely related keys like G major and E major** before returning to E minor.
8. **Instrument and Interpretation**: Originally composed for **piano**, the piece benefits from the **light touch and shallow key fall of early 19th-century pianos**, which allow for rapid articulation. On a modern piano, performers must carefully balance **clarity, phrasing, and dynamic shaping**.

# Debussy

1. **Period of Music**: This piece belongs to the **Impressionist period**, which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Impressionist music is characterized by **ambiguous harmonies, fluid textures, and atmospheric soundscapes**.
2. **When in the Composer's Life It Was Composed**: Debussy composed this piece in **1913**, near the end of his life, when he was deeply engaged in exploring new harmonic and rhythmic ideas.
3. **Basic Overarching Characteristics of the Period**: Impressionist music often features **static harmonies, exotic scales (such as whole-tone and pentatonic), parallel motion, and an emphasis on instrumental timbres** to create shimmering effects.
4. **Is the Work Part of a Larger Collection?**: Yes, it is part of **Debussy’s Préludes, Book 2**, a set of 12 piano pieces published in 1913.
5. **Influences or Inspirations**: The piece was inspired by **General Edward Lavine**, an American vaudeville performer known for his eccentric stage antics. Debussy also drew influence from **ragtime and cakewalk rhythms**, reflecting his fascination with American jazz.
6. **Style and Character**: The piece is **humorous and playful**, mimicking Lavine’s stiff, jerky movements with **syncopated rhythms and exaggerated gestures**. It has a **satirical, dance-like quality**, resembling a cakewalk.
7. **Form and Basic Key Structure**: The piece follows a **free, episodic structure**, with contrasting sections that evoke different aspects of Lavine’s performance. It is primarily in **F major**, but features **chromatic shifts and harmonic ambiguity** typical of Debussy’s style.
8. **Instrument and Interpretation**: Originally composed for **piano**, the piece benefits from **Debussy’s delicate touch and nuanced pedaling techniques**. The performer must balance **precise articulation with expressive phrasing** to capture the comedic and eccentric nature of the work.
