## Bio

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was an Austrian pianist and composer from the Classical period. Together with Haydn and Beethoven (the "First Viennese School"), he represented the culmination of the Classical era. Mozart excelled in all of the main genres of instrumental and vocal music of his day, including operas, symphonies, concertos, quartets and sonatas.

Mozart was born in 1756 in Salzburg, where his father, Leopold, was a composer and deputy Kapellmeister (director of music) to the Prince-Archbishop. As a young boy, Mozart showed prodigious talent on the piano and violin. He began to compose at the age of five, and the following year he was taken by his father on the first of several extensive and very successful concert tours. The “Grand Tour” of 1763-1766 encompassed most of the important European musical centres, with extended stays in Paris and in London, where Mozart became acquainted with Johann Christian Bach. This tour, and his later travels, enabled Mozart to encounter a much broader range of music and musicians than would ever have been possible in Salzburg.

Mozart entered the service of the Archbishop in 1769, but was treated poorly, and disagreements arose. He continued to travel, including several visits to Italy, and an extended trip to Mannheim, Paris and Munich in 1777-1778. He finally left the Archbishop in 1781, settling in Vienna, where he hoped to find a new post.

Vienna was one of the main musical centres of Europe, and Mozart met many prominent composers there, including Haydn, Clementi and Salieri. He married Constanze Weber in 1782, and they had six children, but only two survived infancy. Mozart earned a modest income from teaching and performing, although he received no official patronage for several years, which was an unusual situation for an 18th-century musician. In 1787 he was appointed to the minor post of Kammermusicus (chamber musician) by Emperor Joseph II. Despite this patronage and the success of his operas, neither his health nor his financial situation was secure, and he died in Vienna in 1791, at the age of 35.

Mozart’s compositions demonstrate a synthesis of the various European musical styles that he had encountered during his extensive travels. Among these, the most importan

## Compositions

Mozart’s compositions for piano include:

- 27 concertos.
- 18 sonatas.
- 16 sets of variations, including Ah vous dirai-je, maman.
- three fantasies.
- four rondos.
His other works include:
- 16 operas (e.g. The marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and The magic flute).

- concertos (e.g. five for violin, four for horn, two for flute, one for clarinet, and one for flute and harp).
- chamber music (e.g. 25 string quartets, six string quintets, 35 violin sonatas and a clarinet quintet).

## Compositional Style

Mozart was one of the leading representatives of the Classical style (c.1750-c.1810), which is usually light and elegant, characterised by:

- short, balanced phrases (antecedent and consequent, or question and answer).
- homophony (one melodic line, with simple chordal or broken chord accompaniments).
- predominantly diatonic harmonies, often based on the primary triads (I, IV, V7).
- modulations to closely related keys, typically up or down a 5th.
- steady (though not rigid) pulse.
- clearly articulated sound, with many detached notes and short slurs.
- ornamentation, particularly at cadence points.
- thematic development and highly-organised formal structure.

## Mozart's Piano Sonatas

A sonata is a composition for one or more instruments in several contrasting movements. The name comes from the Italian word suonare, which means “to play” or “to sound”. Mozart’s 18 piano sonatas each contain three movements (usually fast-slow-fast). All but two are in major keys, using key signatures of up to three sharps or three flats.

Mozart’s compositions were catalogued by the Austrian musicologist Ludwig von Köchel. The ‘K’ numbers identify each work in more-or-less chronological order

## Sonata in C Major K330

This sonata was first published in 1784. Its date and place of composition remain open to conjecture; most current sources now suggest Munich or Vienna in the early 1780s, though some suggest Paris around 1778. In the latest version of the Köchel catalogue (K6), this sonata is identified as K. 300h. It contains three movements:

1. Allegro moderato, C major, sonata form.
2. Andante cantabile, F major (the subdominant key), minuet and trio form.
3. Allegretto, C major, sonata form.

## I. *Allegro*

This movement is in C Major, in Sonata form

### Exposition

Themes introduced in tonic and dominant keys

1-18

> First subject, **C major**, with an elegant melody in the right hand and a simple broken chord accompaniment in the left hand. The harmony is mostly based on the primary triads (I, IV and V7), above a tonic or dominant pedal (the repeated Cs or Gs).

> Syncopation (eg. the off-beat long note in b. 1), ornamentation and sparkling broken chording give the theme a sense of playfulness. A chromatic *appogiatura* in b. 8 (D# resolving to E) is used for expressive emphasis. 

> The melody consists of 2-bar or 4-bar phrases, which are usually repeated with small variations (bars 3-4, 9-12, and 14-15). The theme sometimes suggests a dialogue between different characters 9eg. bars 5-6 and 7-8 or bars 12 and 13). The closing phrase (b. 16-18) is irregular in length, and ends with a I-V cadence in b. 17-18

19-34

> Second subject, Part I, beginning immediately in **G Major** (the dominant key). There is no real transition or bridge passage. The melody is a little more lyrical in nature than the first subject to begin with, although there is still a suggestion of dialogue between different characters (eg. bars 19-20 and 21-22. Chromatic appoggiaturas (C# and D#) are used more frequently now. 

> As with the first subject theme, the opening 4-bar phase has been repeated with variations in b. 23-26; however the final bar (b. 26) becomes the start of a new strand of the theme, with a semiquaver triplet accompaniment. 

> The harmony remains based on the primary triads at first, but greater variety is introduced toward the end of the passage; the most striking example is the diminished 7th chord with syncopated accent in b. 31.

> This passage has a total length of 16 bars, but the regular 4-bar phrase structure is playfully subverted using 4+3+4+5 bar units. It ends with a V7-I cadence in b. 33-34.

34-42

> Second subject, Part II, continuing in G Major.
