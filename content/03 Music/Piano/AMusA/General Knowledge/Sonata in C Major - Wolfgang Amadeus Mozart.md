## Brief Biography
### Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791)

### **Introduction**

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791) was an Austrian composer and musician, known as one of the most important figures in the history of classical music. Born in Salzburg, he showed incredible musical talent from a very young age, composing over 600 works in his short life. His works include symphonies, operas, concertos, chamber music, and choral pieces. [^10]

### **Early Life and Education**

Mozart was born on **January 27, 1756**, in Salzburg, Austria, to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart. He was the youngest of seven children, though only he and his sister Maria Anna (known as Nannerl) survived childhood.  [^11]


Mozart's father, Leopold, was a professional violinist and composer who recognized his son's extraordinary musical ability very early. Leopold pushed his son to perform and compose from a very young age, and by the age of five, Mozart was already able to play both the keyboard and violin. He also began composing small pieces of music, which was remarkable for someone so young.

As a child, Mozart and his sister Nannerl went on long European tours with their father. They performed for many royal families, which allowed Mozart to be exposed to many different styles of music across Europe. He learned from famous composers like Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel, as well as from Italian opera composers. This wide range of influences helped shape his own musical style.  [^12]

### **Career**

In 1773, after returning from Italy, Mozart took a job as a court musician in Salzburg, working for Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus Colloredo. During this time, he wrote many symphonies, operas, and chamber music. However, Mozart was unhappy with his position in Salzburg, feeling restricted by the lack of creative freedom.

In 1781, Mozart visited Vienna, where he was dismissed from his position in Salzburg and chose to stay. This marked a turning point in his life, as he sought to establish himself as an independent composer in the vibrant city of Vienna. There, he became famous for composing both operas and instrumental music.

In Vienna, Mozart wrote some of his most famous works, including the operas _The Abduction from the Seraglio_ (Die Entführung aus dem Serail), _Don Giovanni_, _The Magic Flute_, and _The Marriage of Figaro_. His operas are known for their deep emotional expression, complex characters, and beautiful melodies.

In addition to operas, Mozart wrote many piano concertos, symphonies, string quartets, and chamber music. Some of his best-known works in these genres include his _Piano Concerto No. 21_, _Symphony No. 40_, and _String Quartet No. 17_ in D minor. He also developed the piano concerto as a genre, showcasing his talents as both a composer and a virtuoso pianist.

### **Personal Life**

In 1782, Mozart married **Constanze Weber**, the daughter of a well-known musician. The couple had six children, but only two survived to adulthood. Despite his success as a composer, Mozart often struggled with money. He lived a lavish lifestyle and frequently found himself in debt, relying on commissions from aristocrats and the sale of his music to survive financially.

### **Legacy and Death**

Mozart passed away on **December 5, 1791**, at the age of 35. His death is often surrounded by mystery, with some people speculating that he was poisoned, although most historians believe he died from an illness like rheumatic fever or kidney disease. Mozart was buried in a common grave, as was typical for middle-class citizens in Vienna at the time.

Even though he died young, Mozart's music has had an enormous influence on classical music. His works are admired for their beauty, complexity, and emotional depth. His operas, such as _The Marriage of Figaro_, _Don Giovanni_, and _The Magic Flute_, are still performed all over the world. His symphonies, like _Symphony No. 41_ ("Jupiter"), remain some of the most beloved works in the orchestral repertoire.

Mozart’s ability to combine technical skill with emotional expression has inspired generations of composers, and his works continue to be a central part of classical music.

### The History and Development of the Piano

The modern piano has a long history, evolving from earlier stringed and keyboard instruments. Each stage of its development added new ideas, leading to the dynamic and versatile instrument we know today.

#### **Early Instruments**

1. **Monochord**  
    The monochord, used in ancient Greece, was a single string stretched over a box to study pitch and sound. It wasn’t a performance instrument, but it helped people understand how strings work to create music.  [^14]
3. **Hammered Dulcimer**  
    This instrument, from around 500 BCE, had many strings struck by small hammers. The idea of hitting strings to make sound later inspired the piano’s hammer mechanism.  [^15]
3. **Clavichord**  
    Invented in the 1400s, the clavichord struck strings with small metal pieces when keys were pressed. It allowed players to control volume (soft or loud), but the sound was too quiet for large rooms. [^16]
4. **Harpsichord**  
    The harpsichord, popular in the 1500s and 1600s, plucked strings when keys were pressed. It was louder than the clavichord but couldn’t change volume based on how the keys were played.  [^17]

#### **The First Piano**

The piano was invented around 1700 by Bartolomeo Cristofori in Italy. He called it the _gravicembalo col piano e forte_, which means “harpsichord with soft and loud.”

Cristofori made two big changes:

- He used hammers instead of plucking strings, which allowed players to control volume.
- He added a mechanism (called escapement) so the hammers bounced back after hitting the strings, letting them vibrate freely.

This new instrument could play both soft and loud, making it more expressive than earlier instruments.

#### **Improving the Piano**

Between 1790 and 1860, the piano improved in many ways:

1. **Stronger Frames**
    
    - A cast iron frame was added, letting strings hold more tension for a louder and richer sound.
2. **Better Strings**
    
    - Bass strings were arranged diagonally (called cross-stringing) over the middle and treble strings, making the sound fuller.
3. **More Keys**
    
    - Early pianos had about 5 octaves (61 keys). The modern piano has 88 keys, allowing for more complex music.

#### **Modern Changes**

In recent times, new types of pianos have been created:

1. **Hybrid Pianos**
    
    - These combine traditional piano mechanics with digital technology, like recording and sound effects.
2. **Digital Pianos**
    
    - These fully electronic pianos simulate the sound and feel of a real piano while being more portable.
