# Bach

## Bio

Johann Sebastian Bach is known as one of the ==greatest composers== of all time, being a pioneer in ==counterpoint== and ==harmony==, the basis of all modern music. Bach was a ==German== ==composer== and ==organist== from the late ==Baroque== period. He was born into a ==family of musicians== in ==Eisenach== (northern Germany) in ==1685==. Bach received early training in the ==violin and organ== from his father and his older brother, Johann Christoph. At the age of 15 he became a paid chorister at St Michael's church in Lüneburg, followed by various other positions, as violinist and organist.

Bach was an unrivalled ==master of counterpoint==, and a lot of his music is highly complex. Throughout his life, he was appreciated more for his ==brilliant organ playing== and ==improvisatory skill== than for his compositions.

Bach was a devout ==Lutheran==, and his faith profoundly ==influenced== his music.

### Weimar Period (1703-1708)

- **Positions**: Bach began as a ==court organist== to the Duke of Weimar and later became the ==concertmaster== of the court orchestra.
- **Style and Works**: This period was characterized by his mastery of the ==organ== and the development of his contrapuntal style. He composed intricate organ works, cantatas, and instrumental music. His works from this time, such as the *Toccata and Fugue in D Minor,* show his skill of counterpoint and harmony. His exposure to Italian music especially Vivaldi influenced his style greatly.

### Köthen Period (1717-1723)

- **Positions**: As ==Kapellmeister== to Prince Leopold of Köthen, Bach had the freedom to focus on ==secular== and ==instrumental== music.
- **Style and Works**: This period saw the creation of some of his most celebrated instrumental works, including the *Brandenburg Concertos* and the *Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I.* The absence of church duties allowed him to explore more ==secular== themes and experiment with form and structure.

### Leipzig Period (1723-1750)

- **Positions**: Bach served as ==Cantor== and ==Director== of Music at St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, a role that involved teaching, composing, and overseeing church music.
- **Style and Works**: This period was dominated by his sacred music, including the *Mass in B Minor,* *St. Matthew Passion,* and numerous cantatas. His works from this time are deeply spiritual, blending theological depth with musical innovation.

### Legacy

Bach's music, though underappreciated during his lifetime, laid the ==foundation for modern Western music==. His pioneering work in ==counterpoint==, ==harmony==, and ==musical form== continues to inspire musicians and composers to this day.

- ==counterpoint== (two or more equally important voices heard simultaneously).
- ==ornamentation== and embellishment (e.g. trills), particularly at cadence points.
- ==imitation== between the voices.
- many ==sequences==, sometimes based on *circle of 5ths* harmonic progressions.
- ==modulations== to closely related keys (typically up or down a 5th).
- ==monothematic== form (one main theme per movement).
- long ==phrases==.
- steady ==rhythmic pulse==.
- ==hemiola== rhythm before some important cadence points.
- ==tierce de Picardie== endings for works in minor keys.

# Mozart

## Bio

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was an ==Austrian== ==pianist== and ==composer== from the ==Classical== period. Together with ==Haydn and Beethoven (the "First Viennese School")==, he represented the culmination of the Classical era. Mozart excelled in all of the main genres of instrumental and vocal music of his day, including ==operas==, ==symphonies, concertos, quartets and sonatas==.

Mozart was born in ==1756== in Salzburg, where his ==father, Leopold==, was a composer and deputy *Kapellmeister* (director of music) to the Prince-Archbishop. Mozart showed extreme talent on the piano and violin. He watched his ==sister== play the piano, and undertook ==piano== and composition ==lessons== with his father, ==Leopold==. Mozart began to ==compose at the age of five==, and the following year he was taken by his father on the first of many concert tours. The ==“Grand Tour”== of 1763-1766 embraced most of the important ==European== musical centres, with extended stays in Paris and in London, where Mozart became friends ==Johann Christian Bach==, the son of Johann Sebastian Bach. This tour, and his later travels, enabled Mozart to encounter a broader ==range of music==and ==musicians== outside ==Salzburg==.

Mozart entered the service of the ==Archbishop== in 1769, but was treated poorly, with ==disagreements==. He continued to travel, including several visits to ==Italy, Germany and France==. He finally left the Archbishop in 1781, settling in Vienna, where he hoped to find a new job.

Vienna was one of the main musical centres of Europe, and Mozart met many prominent composers there, including Haydn, Clementi. He married ==Constanze Weber== in 1782, and they had six children, but only two survived infancy. Mozart earned a modest income from ==teaching== and ==performing==. In 1785 began work on operas such as *Le nozze di Figaro (The marriage of Figaro)* with the Italian poet Lorenzo da Ponte. In 1784-6 he composed nine of the greatest piano concertos in literature. In 1787 he was appointed to the job of *Kammermusicus* (chamber musician) by Emperor Joseph II. Despite this support and the success of his operas, ==he was poor in both in his health and finance==, and he died in Vienna in 1791, at the age of 35.

## Contemporaries

## Compositional Style

Mozart was one of the leading representatives of the Classical style (c.1750-c.1810), which is usually light and elegant, characterised by:

- ==short, balanced phrases== (antecedent and consequent, or question and answer).
- ==homophony== (one melodic line, with simple chordal or broken chord accompaniments).
- predominantly ==diatonic harmonies==, often based on the primary triads (I, IV, V7).
- modulations to ==closely related keys==, typically up or down a 5th.
- ==steady== (though not rigid) ==pulse==.
- clearly articulated sound, with many ==detached notes== and ==short slurs==.
- ==ornamentation==, particularly at cadence points.
- ==thematic development== and highly-organised ==formal== structure
- ==syncopation==

# Mendelssohn

## Bio

Mendelssohn is one of the most celebrated and well known composers of the romantic era. Felix Mendelssohn was a ==German== composer from the ==Romantic== period. He was born in ==Hamburg== in ==1809== , into a ==wealthy and well-educated family== (his grandfather was the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn). Although originally Jewish, the family ==converted to Christianity==, and later adopted the name Bartholdy. Mendelssohn received an extensive liberal education encompassing ==art, literature and music==. He displayed prodigious talent in ==performance and composition from an early age==; his *String Octet* and the Overture to *A Midsummer Night's Dream* were both written before he was 18. In ==1829==, at the age of 20, Mendelssohn ==conducted the first performance of the *St Matthew Passion* since Bach's death.== Mendelssohn was one of the key contributors to Bach's fame today.

In the 1830s he ==toured== widely, being particularly ==well received in England==, where he was a favourite of Queen Victoria. Mendelssohn later became ==conductor== of the ==Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra==, and was a ==founder== and ==director== of the ==Conservatory== there. He suffered from poor ==health== and a ==gruelling work schedule== in his final years; he died in ==Leipzig== in ==1847==, and although only 38 when he died, he was said to have already looked like an old man.

## Contemporaries

German: ==Robert Schumann==, Richard Wagner

Other: Hector Berlioz, ==Frederic Chopin, Franz Liszt==

## Compositions

For Piano: three *Sonatas*, five *Fantasies*, eight sets of ==*Songs without words*==, seven *Preludes and Fugues*, ==*Rondo Capriccioso*, *Variations sériuses*==.

Other: five symphonies, including 'Scottish', 'Italian' and 'Reformation', ==two piano concertos==, a violin concerto, concert overtures, including *The Hebrides* and *Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage* the oratorios *St Paul* and *Elijah*, chamber music such as the string quartet.

## Compositional Style

Mendelssohn's music is ==elegant== and charming; ==in== this respect, and in his fondness of ==classical== formal structures, he was ==more 'classical'== than Schumann or Chopin, who were born one year late. The ==lyricism== of his melodies and chromaticism (albeit restrained) of his ==harmonies== are '==romantic==' characteristics of his style. Foremost among the forms at which he ==excelled== was the ==Scherzo==, such as that from *A Midsummer Night's Dream*.

Romantic characteristics of the piece include:

- highly ==expressive== character with frequent ==changes of mood==
- ==lyrical== melodies
- ==rich harmonies== using ==chromaticism==
- sparkling ==virtuosity

# Debussy

## Bio

Claude Debussy born on August 22, ==1862==, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, ==France==, was one of the most influential composers of the ==late 19th and early 20th centuries==. He grew up in modest circumstances, and his musical talent was recognized early. At the age of ten, he entered the ==Paris Conservatoire==, where he ==studied piano and composition==. Despite his brilliance, Debussy often clashed with the Conservatoire's conservative professors due to his unconventional ideas.

He won the prestigious ==Prix de Rome== in 1884 with his cantata ~~*L'Enfant prodigue*~~, which allowed him to study in ==Rome==. However, he found the experience stifling and returned to Paris. During this period, he was influenced by Russian composers like ==Mussorgsky== and the exotic sounds of the Javanese gamelan.

He sought to create music that was more ==fluid== and ==atmospheric==, drawing inspiration from Symbolist ==poets== and Impressionist ==painters==. His works, such as, *Clair de lune* (part of *Suite bergamasque*, 1890–1905), and *La Mer* (1905), are celebrated for their innovative use of ==harmony== and ==orchestral color==.

In 1902, Debussy achieved international fame with his opera *Pelléas et Mélisande*, which showcased his unique approach to musical storytelling. Throughout his career, he composed a wide range of works, including piano pieces, orchestral compositions, and chamber music. His later years were marked by illness and the challenges of World War I. Despite these difficulties, he continued to compose, completing three of six planned sonatas for various instruments.

Debussy passed away on March 25, 1918, in Paris, after battling cancer. His legacy endures as a pioneer who reshaped the landscape of classical music, influencing generations of composers and musicians.

## Contemporaries

The other great 'impressionist' composer was Maurice Ravel (1875-1937), who of course was also French. Other contemporaries of Debussy composing in very different styles include Puccini, Mahler, Bartók and Stravinsky.

## Compositions

Debussy's output includes the opera *Palléas et Mélisande*, orchestral music (including *Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune* and *La mer*), many songs, chamber and choral music, and much piano music (including *Images*, *Estampes*, *Children's Corner*, *Préludes* and *Etudes*, and *Fantasy* for piano and orchestra). In his music, he deliberately attempted to create a distinctively French style, proudly describing himself as 'Musicien Français'.

## Compositional Style

Debussy's musical style has an affinity with two other characteristically French genres - the *impressionist* painters (eg. Monet, Manet and Degas) and the *symbolist* writers (eg. Verlaine and Mallarmé). The label 'impressionist' is the one most commonly applied to Debussy's music (in spite of the fact that the composer himself objected to it).

- Frequent use of 7th and 9th chords
- Parallel movement of chords
- Use of parallel 5ths in the bass
- Pedal points
- Rhythmic fluidity
