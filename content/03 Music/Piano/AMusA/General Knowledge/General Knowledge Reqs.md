Guidelines for Level 3 Candidates will be expected to demonstrate a mature understanding of the structure, style and historical background of the repertoire that is performed and to use this as a basis for discussing the interpretive choices that they make.

Questions, which will be asked from the full piano score, will focus on the following areas:

• Terminology, including the significance of titles and the meaning of all markings contained in the score.

• Composers: relevant biographical information, sources of influence, impact upon later generations of composers and repertoire output (both in the discipline being examined and more broadly).

• Historical and stylistic context: how each work relates to the period from which it arises, considering both its compositional style and the performance conventions of the time.

• Structure: formal layout, keys, melodic/harmonic language and the identification of climax points.

• For instrumentalists, the construction and development of the instrument, with special

consideration given to any implications this may have upon the repertoire that is performed.

Candidates must provide the examiners with clear, unmarked copies of all scores, including the piano part In addition to the guidelines above, Level 3 candidates in Woodwind, Percussion, Band, Musical Theatre and Singing must consult the General Knowledge requirements in these syllabuses as they contain certain requirements specific to these syllabuses.
