# Composer

## Bio

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was an ==Austrian== ==pianist== and ==composer== from the ==Classical== period. Together with ==Haydn and Beethoven (the "First Viennese School")==, he represented the culmination of the Classical era. Mozart excelled in all of the main genres of instrumental and vocal music of his day, including ==operas==, ==symphonies, concertos, quartets and sonatas==.

Mozart was born in ==1756== in Salzburg, where his ==father, Leopold==, was a composer and deputy *Kapellmeister* (director of music) to the Prince-Archbishop. Mozart showed extreme talent on the piano and violin. He watched his ==sister== play the piano, and undertook ==piano== and composition ==lessons== with his father, ==Leopold==. Mozart began to ==compose at the age of five==, and the following year he was taken by his father on the first of many concert tours. The ==“Grand Tour”== of 1763-1766 embraced most of the important ==European== musical centres, with extended stays in Paris and in London, where Mozart became friends ==Johann Christian Bach==, the son of Johann Sebastian Bach. This tour, and his later travels, enabled Mozart to encounter a broader ==range of music==and ==musicians== outside ==Salzburg==.

Mozart entered the service of the ==Archbishop== in 1769, but was treated poorly, with ==disagreements==. He continued to travel, including several visits to ==Italy, Germany and France==. He finally left the Archbishop in 1781, settling in Vienna, where he hoped to find a new job.

Vienna was one of the main musical centres of Europe, and Mozart met many prominent composers there, including Haydn, Clementi. He married ==Constanze Weber== in 1782, and they had six children, but only two survived infancy. Mozart earned a modest income from ==teaching== and ==performing==. In 1785 began work on operas such as *Le nozze di Figaro (The marriage of Figaro)* with the Italian poet Lorenzo da Ponte. In 1784-6 he composed nine of the greatest piano concertos in literature. In 1787 he was appointed to the job of *Kammermusicus* (chamber musician) by Emperor Joseph II. Despite this support and the success of his operas, ==he was poor in both in his health and finance==, and he died in Vienna in 1791, at the age of 35.

## Contemporaries

Mozart’s contemporaries

- Joseph Haydn (Austrian, 1732-1809).

## Compositions

Mozart’s compositions for piano include:

- 27 ==concertos==.
- 18 ==sonatas==.
- 16 sets of ==variations==, including Ah vous dirai-je, maman.
- three ==fantasies==.
- four ==rondos==.
His other works include:
- 16 ==operas== (e.g. The marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and The magic flute).

- ==chamber music== (e.g. 25 string quartets, six string quintets, 35 violin sonatas and a clarinet quintet)

## Compositional Style

Mozart was one of the leading representatives of the Classical style (c.1750-c.1810), which is usually light and elegant, characterised by:

- ==short, balanced phrases== (antecedent and consequent, or question and answer).
- ==homophony== (one melodic line, with simple chordal or broken chord accompaniments).
- predominantly ==diatonic harmonies==, often based on the primary triads (I, IV, V7).
- modulations to ==closely related keys==, typically up or down a 5th.
- ==steady== (though not rigid) ==pulse==.
- clearly articulated sound, with many ==detached notes== and ==short slurs==.
- ==ornamentation==, particularly at cadence points.
- ==thematic development== and highly-organised ==formal== structure
- ==syncopation==

# Piece

## Mozart's Piano Sonata

A *sonata* is a composition for one or more instruments in several contrasting movements. The name comes from the Italian word suonare, which means “to play” or “to sound”. The sonata was developed in part for audiences to listen to longer pieces of music. Mozart’s 18 piano sonatas each contain three movements (usually fast-slow-fast). All but two are in major keys, using key signatures of up to three sharps or three flats.

Mozart’s compositions were catalogued by the Austrian musicologist Ludwig von Köchel. The ‘K’ numbers identify each work in more-or-less chronological order.

## Sonata in C Major, K330

This sonata was first published in 1784. Its date and place of composition remain open to conjecture; most current sources now suggest Munich or Vienna in the early 1780s, though some suggest Paris around 1778. In the latest version of the Köchel catalogue (K6), this sonata is identified as K. 300h. It contains three movements:

1. *Allegro moderato*, C major, sonata form.
2. *Andante cantabile*, F major (the subdominant key), Minuet and Trio form.
3. *Allegretto*, C major, sonata form

### Analysis

#### I. Allegro

This movement is in **C Major**, in Sonata form

**Exposition**

Themes introduced in tonic and dominant keys.

1-18

> ==First subject==, **C major**, with an elegant melody in the ==right hand== and a simple broken chord ==accompaniment== in the left hand. *The harmony is mostly based on the primary triads (I, IV and V7), above a tonic or dominant pedal (the repeated Cs or Gs).*
>
> ==Syncopation== (e.g. the off-beat long note in 1), ==ornamentation== and sparkling ==broken chords== give the theme a sense of ==playfulness==.
>
> The melody consists of ==2-bar or 4-bar phrases==, *which are usually repeated with small variations (3-4, 9-12 and 14-15). The theme sometimes suggests a dialogue between different characters (5-6 and 7-8, or bars 12 and 13).* The closing phrase (16-18) is irregular in length, and ends with a ==I-V== cadence in (17-18).

19-34

> ==Second subject==, ==Part I==, beginning immediately in **G major** (the dominant key). The melody is a little more ==lyrical== than the first subject to begin with, *although there is still a suggestion of dialogue between different characters (19-20 and 21-22).*
>
> The harmony remains based on the primary triads at first, but greater variety is introduced toward the end of the passage; *the most striking example is the diminished 7th chord with syncopated accent in (31).* This passage has a total length of 16 bars, but the regular 4==-bar phrase structure== is playfully subverted using ==4+3+4+5 bar units==. It ends with a ==V7-I== cadence in (33-34).

34-42

> ==Second subject==, ==Part II==, continuing in **G major.** There are ==two 4-bar phrases==, each beginning with a syncopated accent *that again subverts the metric structure*. The first phrase is unaccompanied for the first two bars. Chromatic passing notes are sometimes used (e.g. right hand in 36, left hand in 37-38). The ==first phrase== ends on chord V in (38). The ==second phrase== is a ==variation== of the first, ending with a ==V7-I== cadence in (41-42).

42-53

> ==Second subject==, ==Part III==, continuing in **G major**, *with an energetic character, often using demisemiquavers.* The harmony consists mostly of the primary triads. The theme ends with a ==V7-I==cadence in (47-48), decorated with a trill and preceded by a ==“cadential 6/4”==. (48-53) are a slightly embellished repeat of (42-47), leading directly to…

54-58

> ==Closing theme==, **G major**, using only ==tonic and dominant 7th harmony.==

**Development**

A contrasting episode

59-66

> This passage uses a new theme, although the undulating semiquaver accompaniment recalls that of the ==first subject==. It remains mostly in **G major**, beginning with a ==sequence==, using some chromatic passing notes and ==some 9th or diminished 7th chords for colour (e.g. G-B-(D)-F-Ab, end of 59).== The key is reconfirmed by a ==V7-I== cadence in (65-66), decorated with a trill and preceded by a ==cadential 6/4==.

66-87

> The development continues, still without direct reference to thematic material from the exposition, but using a similar ==broken chord accompaniment== to the second subject. *The tonic triad of G major becomes a dominant 7th of C in (68), which unexpectedly leads (via semitone movement in the bass) to A minor in (69-71).* *Diminished 7th harmony and syncopated rhythm in (69-70) add intensity to this passage.*
>
> The mood becomes ==warmer== again in (72), passing through **F major** (72-73) and **D minor** (74), without settling in either of those keys. The melody descends by semitones in (75-77), settling in **C minor** (the tonic minor key) from the end of (76). *Diminished 7th harmony in (78) leads to the dominant chord in (79).*
>
> The melody often falls by semitones in (79-82), with a dominant pedal in the bass. (83-87) return to **C major**, initially based around the dominant 7th chord, then using scales in 10ths in (86-87), to lead to the ==recapitulation==.

**Recapitulation**

Themes restated, mostly in the tonic key.

88-105

> ==First subject==, **C major**, as before, with slight variations *(e.g. the additional note in the broken chords in (92-93), and the use of scales instead of broken chords in 96-97)*

106-140

> ==Second subject group==, now mostly in **C major**. It begins in **G major**, though, in order to highlight the return to **C major** in (109), so (106-112) do have a transitional function now. *(110-140) are mostly a transposition of (23-53) up a 4th, with small changes from (129).*

141-150

> ==Closing theme==, all in **C Major**, beginning as a transposition of (54-58) up a 4th. (145-150) Reprise the opening the Development with a tonic pedal in the bass.

*Allegro moderato* means moderately fast.

![[Pasted image 20250418235536.png]]

*demisemiquavers* - 1/32nd note

![[Pasted image 20250418235634.png]]

*appoggiatura* - it is played on the beat, reducing the length of the next note, as if 'leaning' on it. The note value used for the appoggiatura gives an approximate indication of its length. In some cases, particularly when then note it precedes is very short, it may be interpreted as an *acciaccatura* (crushed note).

![[Pasted image 20250418235717.png]]

The grace notes in (27) form a written-out *slide* or *Schleifer*.

![[Pasted image 20250418235726.png]]

*fp* (*fortepiano*) means loud, then immediately soft.

![[Pasted image 20250418235735.png]]

*sf(orazndo)* indicates an accent. (The > sign was rarely used before the 19th century).

#### II. Andante Cantabile

This movement is in **F Major**, in ==minuet and trio form== (a type of compound ternary, ie. ABA with internal subdivisions). Sections A and B are each in binary form, indicated by the repeat signs. Section B (the Trio) is in a contrasting mood and key to Section A. When Section A returns, there are no repeats.

This movement begins with an *anacrusis* (an upbeat). (1) is the first complete bar.

**A**

1-8

> The opening theme contains a pair of ==balanced== ==4 bar phrases==, with a ==lyrical== character. The first phrase is all in **F Major**, coming to rest on the ==dominant chord== in (4). The second phrase modulates to **C Major** (the ==dominant== key) from (5), ending with a ==V7-I== cadence in (7-8).

9-20

> Beginning in **G minor** (continuing the series of modulations by 5ths), returning to **F Major** from the end of (10). There is a passing suggestion of **Bb Major** in (14-16), but elsewhere the key of F **Major** prevails, confirmed by a **V7-I** cadence in (19-20).
>
> *This passage contains some similar motives to the opening theme, including the repeated note anacrusis (12-14) and the cadential bars, but is generally less tranquil in nature, due to the minor tonality (9-10), the melodic leap of a 7th (12-13) and the stronger bass line (13). Suspensions (where the last note of one bar is repeated in the next bar, despite the change of harmony, e.g. the first notes 10, 14, and 16) create then release harmonic tension, and appoggiaturas (e.g. the highest note of 11) are used for similar effect.*

21-28

> ==Trio==, beginning very softly in **F minor** (the tonic minor key), with a ==tonic pedal== in repeated semiquavers in the bass at first. As with Section A, the melody begins with a repeated note anacrusis, and consists of two ==balanced 4-bar phrases==. The second phrase modulates to **Ab major** from (25). ==Pitch and volume reach a climax== in (26), then ==decline== again. The ==V7-I== chord cadence in (27-28) again recalls the previous cadences (7-8 and 19-20) in its ==rhythm and pitch contour==.

29-36

> Beginning in **Ab major** and returning to **F minor** in (30). The melody contains a ==sequence== in (29-32), and the left hand has a more ==contrapuntal== feel in this passage. The bass line rises by semitones in (33-34), building dramatic tension in conjunction with the increase in volume. Secondary dominant 7th harmony (V7 of IV) is used at the end of (34), and the passage ends with a ==V-i== cadence in (35-36).

37-40

> ==Codetta==, all in **F minor**, using the Trio theme, with a ==tonic pedal== in the bass.

41-60

> A ==reprise== of (1-20), without the repeats, beginning the ending in **F Major**.

61-64

> ==Coda==, remaining in **F Major**, using the ==Trio== theme, ending with a ==V7-I== cadence.

### III. Allegretto

**Exposition**

Themes introduced in tonic and dominant keys

1-20

> ==First subject==, all in **C major**, with a ==bright and cheerful character==. *The 8-bar theme is heard twice, p (ending on the dominant chord in 8) then f (ending on the tonic chord in 16),* followed by a closing passage of triplet broken chords in (16-20).
>
> *The harmony consists almost entirely of the primary triads (I, IV and V7). Suspensions (e.g. the first note of 2), appoggiaturas (e.g. 2) and accented chromatic passing notes (e.g. the first notes of 8 and 15) are used to create harmonic interest.* The passage ends with a ==V7-I== cadence in (19-20).

21-32

> ==Transition==, beginning with a pair of ==4-bar phrases== in **C major,** *the F#s in the left hand in (21-25) are chromatic auxiliary notes*. The melody mostly moves by step. The accompaniment is in constant semiquavers, in an =='Alberti bass'== style; the traditional Alberti bass pattern can be heard in (28).
>
> (29-32) return to triple broken chords, modulating to **G major** from (31) and ending on the dominant chord in (32).

33-46

> ==Second Subject Part I==, **G Major** (the dominant key), with a ==graceful== melody over a semiquaver broken chord accompaniment. (39-46) contain exuberant ==trills== and detached notes in the melody, with an ==Alberti bass== accompaniment.

47-61

> ==Second subject, Part II==, continuing in **G Major**, using triplet broken chords. *Secondary dominant 7th (V7 of IV, 52 and 56) and diminished (54 and 58) chords* lead to ==V7-I== cadences in (54-55) and (60-61), reach preceded by a ==cadential 6/4==.

61-68

> ==Closing theme==, **G Major**, mostly using tonic and dominant 7th harmony, with a tonic pedal in the bass in (61-66) and a ==V7-I== cadence in (67-68). The final tonic chord is decorated with a ==double suspension== (C and A,  resolving to B and G).

**Development**

A contrasting episode, with occasional references to previous themes.

69-76

> A new theme in **G Major**, with a humorous character. *It bears no direct relation to the previous thematic material, apart from the similarity of its final bar (76) to the end of the closing theme (68). The theme consists mostly of repeated notes and 2 note slurs.*

77-95

> The ==episode== theme is restated, now with a semiquaver ==Alberti bass== style of accompaniment that recalls (33-34 and 27-28, etc.) The theme is extended from (81), returning to **C major**. There is a brief hint of the opening bar of the **first subject** theme in (85).
>
> Bars 87-95 are in **C minor** (the tonic minor key), usually with a dominant pedal in the bass. The harmony consists mostly of tonic and dominant chords, but a “German” augmented 6th chord (Ab-C-Eb-F#) in (91) adds intensity, leading strongly to the dominant chord of **C minor/major** in (92-93) (becoming a dominant 7th in 94-95)

**Recapitulation**

Themes restated, now mostly in the tonic

96-115

> ==First subject==, **C major**

116-131

> ==Transition==, beginning in the same way as before. The triplet broken chord passage is now altered and extended, passing sequentially through **F major** (b.124-125) and **D major** (b.126-127), then returning to **C major**. The passage ends on the dominant chord of **C major** in (131), preceded by its dominant 7th at the end of (130).

131-160

> ==Second subject==, now in **C major**, mostly a transposition of (33-61) up a 4th or down a 5th, with small variations *(including the added anacrusis in 131 and 135, and the melodic alterations in 151 and 155).*

160-171

> ==Closing theme==, beginning as a transposition of (60-66) down a 5th, then slightly extended. The harmony takes an unexpected turn with a type of ==interrupted cadential progression== in b.168-169, but clarity is restored with a strong ==ii6-V7-I== progression in (170-171).
