# Composer

## Bio

Mozart Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was an Austrian pianist and composer from the Classical period. Together with Haydn and Beethoven (the "First Viennese School"), he represented the culmination of the Classical era. Mozart excelled in all of the main genres of instrumental and vocal music of his day, including operas, symphonies, concertos, quartets and sonatas.

Mozart was born in 1756 in Salzburg, where his father, Leopold, was a composer and deputy *Kapellmeister* (director of music) to the Prince-Archbishop. As a young boy, Mozart showed prodigious talent on the piano and violin. He began to compose at the age of five, and the following year he was taken by his father on the first of several extensive and very successful concert tours. The “Grand Tour” of 1763-1766 encompassed most of the important European musical centres, with extended stays in Paris and in London, where Mozart became acquainted with Johann Christian Bach. This tour, and his later travels, enabled Mozart to encounter a much broader range of music and musicians than would ever have been possible in Salzburg.

Mozart entered the service of the Archbishop in 1769, but was treated poorly, and disagreements arose. He continued to travel, including several visits to Italy, and an extended trip to Mannheim, Paris and Munich in 1777-1778. He finally left the Archbishop in 1781, settling in Vienna, where he hoped to find a new post.

Vienna was one of the main musical centres of Europe, and Mozart met many prominent composers there, including Haydn, Clementi and Salieri. He married Constanze Weber in 1782, and they had six children, but only two survived infancy. Mozart earned a modest income from teaching and performing, although he received no official patronage for several years, which was an unusual situation for an 18th-century musician. In 1787 he was appointed to the minor post of *Kammermusicus* (chamber musician) by Emperor Joseph II. Despite this patronage and the success of his operas, neither his health nor his financial situation was secure, and he died in Vienna in 1791, at the age of 35.

Mozart’s compositions demonstrate a synthesis of the various European musical styles that he had encountered during his extensive travels. Among these, the most important include Italian opera (e.g. Piccinni, Galuppi, etc.) and the works of Haydn and JC Bach.

## Compositional Style

Mozart was one of the leading representatives of the Classical style (c.1750-c.1810), which is usually light and elegant, characterised by:

- short, balanced phrases (antecedent and consequent, or question and answer).
- homophony (one melodic line, with simple chordal or broken chord accompaniments).
- predominantly diatonic harmonies, often based on the primary triads (I, IV, V7).
- modulations to closely related keys, typically up or down a 5th.
- steady (though not rigid) pulse.
- clearly articulated sound, with many detached notes and short slurs.
- ornamentation, particularly at cadence points.
- thematic development and highly-organised formal structure

# Piece

## Mozart's Piano Sonata

A *sonata* is a composition for one or more instruments in several contrasting movements. The name comes from the Italian word suonare, which means “to play” or “to sound”. Mozart’s 18 piano sonatas each contain three movements (usually fast-slow-fast). All but two are in major keys, using key signatures of up to three sharps or three flats.

Mozart’s compositions were catalogued by the Austrian musicologist Ludwig von Köchel. The ‘K’ numbers identify each work in more-or-less chronological order.

## Sonata in C Major, K330

This sonata was first published in 1784. Its date and place of composition remain open to conjecture; most current sources now suggest Munich or Vienna in the early 1780s, though some suggest Paris around 1778. In the latest version of the Köchel catalogue (K6), this sonata is identified as K. 300h. It contains three movements:

1. *Allegro moderato*, C major, sonata form.
2. *Andante cantabile*, F major (the subdominant key), minuet and trio form.
3. *Allegretto*, C major, sonata form

### Analysis

#### I. Allegro

This movement is in C Major, in Sonata form

**Exposition**

Themes introduced in tonic and dominant keys.

1-18

> First subject, **C major**, with an elegant melody in the right hand and a simple broken chord accompaniment in the left hand. The harmony is mostly based on the primary triads (I, IV and V7), above a tonic or dominant pedal (the repeated Cs or Gs).
>
> Syncopation (e.g. the off-beat long note in (1)), ornamentation and sparkling broken chords give the theme a sense of playfulness. A chromatic appoggiatura in (8) (Ds, resolving to E) is used for expressive emphasis.
>
> The melody consists of 2-bar or 4-bar phrases, which are usually repeated with small variations (3-4, 9-12 and 14-15). The theme sometimes suggests a dialogue between different characters (5-6 and 7-8, or bars 12 and 13). The closing phrase (16-18) is irregular in length, and ends with a I-V cadence in (17-18).

19-34

> Second subject, Part I, beginning immediately in G **major** (the dominant key). There is no real transition or bridge passage. The melody is a little more lyrical in nature than the first subject to begin with, although there is still a suggestion of dialogue between different characters (19-20 and 21-22). Chromatic appoggiaturas (Cs and Ds) are used more frequently now.
>
> As with the first subject theme, the opening 4-bar phrase has been repeated with variations in (23-26); however, the final bar (26) becomes the start of a new strand of the theme, with a semiquaver triplet accompaniment.
>
> The harmony remains based on the primary triads at first, but greater variety is intro- duced toward the end of the passage; the most striking example is the diminished 7th chord with syncopated accent in (31). This passage has a total length of 16 bars, but the regular 4-bar phrase structure is playfully subverted using 4+3+4+5 bar units. It ends with a V7-I cadence in (33-34).

34-42

> Second subject, Part II, continuing in G major. There are two 4-bar phrases, each beginning with a syncopated accent that again subverts the metric structure. The first phrase is unaccompanied for the first two bars. Chromatic passing notes are some- times used (e.g. right hand in 36, left hand in 37-38). The first phrase ends on the dominant chord in (38). The second phrase is a variation of the first, ending with a V7-I cadence in (41-42).

42-53

> Second subject, Part III, continuing in G major, with an exuberant character, often using demisemiquavers. The harmony consists mostly of the primary triads. The theme ends with a V7-I cadence in (47-48), decorated with a trill and preceded by a “cadential 6/4”. (48-53) are a slightly embellished repeat of (42-47), leading directly to…

54-58

> Closing theme, G major, using only tonic and dominant 7th harmony.

**Development**
A contrasting episode
59-66
> This passage uses a new theme, although the undulating semiquaver accompaniment recalls that of the first subject. It remains mostly in G major, beginning with a sequence, using some chromatic passing notes and some 9th or diminished 7th chords for colour (e.g. G-B-(D)-F-Ab, end of 59). The key is reconfirmed by a V7-I cadence in (65-66), decorated with a trill and preceded by a cadential 6/4.

66-87

> The development continues, still without direct reference to thematic material from the exposition, but using a similar broken chord accompaniment to the second subject. The tonic triad of G major becomes a dominant 7th of C in (68), which unexpectedly leads (via semitone movement in the bass) to A minor in (69-71). Diminished 7th harmony and syncopated rhythm in (69-70) add intensity to this passage.
>
> The mood becomes warmer again in b.72, passing through F major (72-73) and D minor (74), without settling in either of those keys. The melody descends by semitones in (75-77), settling in **C minor** (the tonic minor key) from the end of (76). Diminished 7th harmony in (78) leads to the dominant chord in (79).
>
> The melody often falls by semitones in (79-82), with a dominant pedal in the bass. (83-87) return to C major, initially based around the dominant 7th chord, then using scales in 10ths in (86-87), to lead to the recapitulation.

**Recapitulation**
Themes restated, not mostly in the tonic key.
88-105
> First subject, **C major**, as before, with slight variations (e.g. the additional note in the broken chords in (92-93), and the use of scales instead of broken chords in 96-97)

106-140

> Second subject group, now mostly in C major. It begins in G major, though, in order to highlight the return to C major in (109), so (106-112) do have a transitional function now. (110-140) are mostly a transposition of (23-53) up a 4th, with small changes from (129).

141-150

> Closing theme, all in C Major, beginning as a transposition of (54-58) up a 4th. (145-150) Reprise the opening the Development with a tonic pedal in the bass.

*Allegro moderato* means moderately fast.
The very short notes and rests in this piece are *demisemiquavers*. (38) Contains *hemidemisemiquavers*.
(7) Indicates an appoggiatura; the appoggiatura is played on the beat, reducing the length of the next note, as if 'leaning' on it. The note value used for the appoggiatura gives an approximate indication of its length. In some cases, particularly when then note it precedes is very short, it may be interpreted as an *acciaccatura* (crushed note).
The grace notes in (27) form a written-out *slide* or *Schleifer*.
*fp* (*fortepiano*) means loud, then immediately soft.
*sf(orazndo)* indicates an accent. (The > sign was rarely used before the 19th century).

#### II. Andante Cantabile

This movement is in F Major, in minuet and trio form (a type of compound ternary, IE ABA with internal subdivisions). Sections A and B are each in binary form, dinciated by the repeat signs. Section B (the Trio) is in a contrasting mood and key to Section A. When Section A returns, there are no repeats.

This movement begins with an *anacrusis*. (1) is the first complete bar.

**A**
1-8
> The opening theme contains a pair of balanced 4 bar phrases, with a lyrical character. The first phrase is all in **F Major**, coming to rest on the dominant chord in (4). The second phrase modulates to **C Major** (the dominant key) from (5), ending with a V7-I cadence in (7-8).

9-20

> Beginning in **G minor** (continuing the series of modulations by 5ths), db returning to **F Major** from the end of (10). There is a passing suggesting of Bb Major in (14-16), but elsewhere the key of F Major prevails, confirmed by a V7-1 cadence in (19-20).
>
> This passage contains some similar motives to the opening theme, including the repeated note anacrusis (12-14) and the cadential bars, but is generally less tranquil in nature, due to the minor tonality (9-10), the melodic leap of a 7th (12-13) and the stronger bass line (13). Suspensions (where the last note of one bar is repeated in the next bar, despite the change of harmony, e.g. the first notes 10, 14, and 16) create then release harmonic tension, and appoggiaturas (e.g. the highest note of 11) are used for similar effect.

21-28

> Trio, beginning very softly in **F minor** (the tonic minor key), with a tonic pedal in repeated semiquavers in the bass at first. As with Section A, the melody begins with a repeated note anacrusis, and consists of two balanced 4-bar phrases. The second phrase modulates to **Ab major** from (25). Pitch and volume reach a climax in (26), then decline again. The V7-I chord cadence in (27-28) again recalls the previous cadences (7-8 and 19-20) in its rhythm and pitch contour.

29-36

> Beginning in Ab major and returning to **F minor** in (30). The melody contains a sequence in (29-32), and the left hand has a more contrapuntal feel in this passage. The bass line rises by semitones in (33-34), building dramatic tension in conjunction with the increase in volume. Secondary dominant 7th harmony (V7 of iv) is used at the end of (34), and the passage ends with a V-i cadence in (35-36).

37-40
> Codetta, all in F minor, using the Trio theme, with a tonic pedal in the bass.


41-60
> A reprise of (1-20), without the repeats, beginning the ending in **F Major**.

61-64
> Coda, remaining in F Major, using the Trio theme, ending with a V7-I cadence.
