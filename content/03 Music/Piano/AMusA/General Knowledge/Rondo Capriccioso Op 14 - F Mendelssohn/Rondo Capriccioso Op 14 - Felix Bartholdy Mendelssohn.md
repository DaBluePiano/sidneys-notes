# Composer

## Bio

Felix Mendelssohn was a German composer from the Romantic period. He was born in Hamburg in 1809 , into a wealthy and well-educated family (his grandfather was the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn). Although originally Jewish, the family converted to Christianity, and later adopted the name Bartholdy. Mendelssohn received an extensive liberal education encompassing art, literature and music. He displayed prodigious talent in performance and composition form an early age; his *String Octet* and the Overture to *A Midsummer Night's Dream* were both written before he was 18. In 1829, at the age of 20, Mendelssohn conducted the first performance of the *St Matthew Passion* since Bach's death.

In the 1830s he toured widely, being particularly well received in England, where he was a favourite of Queen Victoria. Mendelssohn later became conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, and was a founder and director of the Conservatory there. He suffered from poor health and a gruelling work schedule in his final years; he died in Leipzig in 1847, and although only 38 when he died, he was said to have already looked like an old man.

## Contemporaries

German: Robert Schumann, Richard Wagner

Other: Hector Berlioz, Frederic Chopin, Franz Liszt

## Compositions

For Piano: three *Sonatas*, five *Fantasies*, eight sets of *Songs without words*, seven *Preludes and Fugues*, *Rondo Capriccioso*,*Variations sÃ©riuses*.

Other: five symphonies, including 'Scottish', 'Italian' and 'Reformation', two piano concertos, a violin concerto, concert overtured, including *The Hebrides* and *Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage* the oratorios *St Paul* and *Elijah*, chamber music such as the string quartet.

## Compositional Style

Mendelssohn's music is elegant and charming; in this respect, and in his fondness of classical formal structures, he was more 'classical' than Schumann or Chopin, who were born one year late. The lyricism of his melodies and chromaticism (albeit restrained) of his harmonies are 'romantic' characteristics of his style. Foremost among the forms at which he excelled was the Scherzo, such as that from *A Midsummer Night's Dream*.

# Piece

## Andante and Rondo Capriccioso Op. 14

A *rondo* is a piece, usually of light and lively nature, in which the main melody returns a number of times. *Capriccioso* indicates that it is capricious and impulsive in character.

There are two contrasting thematic groups in a structure resembling rondo-sonata form. Theme A, always in E minor, is playful and capricious, while Theme B, in the relative major than the tonic major, is more lyrical.

1-26

> Introduction. The first four bars establish the chordal accompaniment pattern which is used throughout most of this section. It begins in **E Major**, with the main melody entering in (4). There are modulations to B Major (dominant, 10-12), C Major (13-15). The opening melody returns in (22), above adominant pedal in the bass which continues to the end of the section, building a sense of expectancy for the *Presto*. There is frequent use of chromatic harmony; in particular, secondary dominant 7ths (eg. 2), diminished 7ths (eg. 5) and augmented 6ths (eg. latter half of 17).

**A**
27-39
> Theme A, **E minor**. A 4-bar phrase, ending with an imperfect cadence, heard twice. The theme features lower auxiliary notes, which are sometimes chromatic (eg. the A# in 28). (35-39) are an extension of the theme, moving in sequence through D minor (35-36) and C minor (37-39).

40-51

> Transition 1. G Major (relative major). The characteristic rhythm of Theme A is still apparent.

52-66

> Theme A. E minor, as before, with the extension coming to rest on the dominant 7th of G Major in (66).

**B**
67-100
> Theme B. **G Major**, *con anima*. A more lyrical melody, heard first in the right hand then in the left. There are brief modulations to A minor (75-77) and E minor (77-79). A sequential passage in (90-94) features diminished 7th chords. The section ends with a strong perfect cadence.

101-110

> Transition 2. *tranquillo*. G Major, with a dominant pedal in (102-105), gradually returning to E minor. There is an augmented 6th chord in (109-110).

**A**
111-124
> Theme A, **E minor**, as before at first, then modulating to A Major (117-118) and G Major (119-124). The augmented 6th chord returns in (123-124).

125-139

> Transition 1. E Major.

**B**
140-196
> Theme B. **E Major** (tonic major). The lyrical theme returns, but only briefly. In (154) it becomes a new theme, based on semiquaver broken chord figuration. Moves to E minor in (166), then back to E Major in (179). The section ends with a strong perfect cadence.

197-206

> Transition 2. *tranquillo*. E Major, with a dominant pedal in bars 199-202, gradually returning to E minor. There is a diminished 7th chord in (205-206).

**A**
207-226
> Theme A. **E minor**, *pp*.

227-242

> Coda, E minor, *ff*.
