## Bio

Felix Mendelssohn was a German composer from the Romantic period. He was born in Hamburg in 1809 , into a wealthy and well-educated family (his grandfather was the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn). Although originally Jewish, the family converted to Christianity, and later adopted the name Bartholdy. Mendelssohn received an extensive liberal education encompassing art, literature and music. He displayed prodigious talent in performance and composition form an early age; his *String Octet* and the Overture to *A Midsummer Night's Dream* were both written before he was 18. In 1829, at the age of 20, Mendelssohn conducted the first performance of the *St Matthew Passion* since Bach's death.

In the 1830s he toured widely, being particularly well received in England, where he was a favourite of Queen Victoria. Mendelssohn later became conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, and was a founder and director of the Conservatory there. He suffered from poor health and a gruelling work schedule in his final years; he died in Leipzig in 1847, and although only 38 when he died, he was said to have already looked like an old man.
