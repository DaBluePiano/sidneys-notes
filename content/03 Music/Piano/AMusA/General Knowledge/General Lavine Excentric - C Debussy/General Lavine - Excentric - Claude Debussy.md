# Composer

## Bio

Claude Debussy born on August 22, ==1862==, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, ==France==, was one of the most influential composers of the ==late 19th and early 20th centuries==. He grew up in modest circumstances, and his musical talent was recognized early. At the age of ten, he entered the ==Paris Conservatoire==, where he ==studied piano and composition==. Despite his brilliance, Debussy often clashed with the Conservatoire's conservative professors due to his unconventional ideas.

He won the prestigious ==Prix de Rome== in 1884 with his cantata ~~*L'Enfant prodigue*~~, which allowed him to study in ==Rome==. However, he found the experience stifling and returned to Paris. During this period, he was influenced by Russian composers like ==Mussorgsky== and the exotic sounds of the Javanese gamelan.

He sought to create music that was more ==fluid== and ==atmospheric==, drawing inspiration from Symbolist ==poets== and Impressionist ==painters==. His works, such as, *Clair de lune* (part of *Suite bergamasque*, 1890–1905), and *La Mer* (1905), are celebrated for their innovative use of ==harmony== and ==orchestral color==.

In 1902, Debussy achieved international fame with his opera *Pelléas et Mélisande*, which showcased his unique approach to musical storytelling. Throughout his career, he composed a wide range of works, including piano pieces, orchestral compositions, and chamber music. His later years were marked by illness and the challenges of World War I. Despite these difficulties, he continued to compose, completing three of six planned sonatas for various instruments.

Debussy passed away on March 25, 1918, in Paris, after battling cancer. His legacy endures as a pioneer who reshaped the landscape of classical music, influencing generations of composers and musicians.

## Contemporaries

The other great 'impressionist' composer was Maurice Ravel (1875-1937), who of course was also French. Other contemporaries of Debussy composing in very different styles include Puccini, Mahler, Bartók and Stravinsky.

## Compositions

Debussy's output includes the opera *Palléas et Mélisande*, orchestral music (including *Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune* and *La mer*), many songs, chamber and choral music, and much piano music (including *Images*, *Estampes*, *Children's Corner*, *Préludes* and *Etudes*, and *Fantasy* for piano and orchestra). In his music, he deliberately attempted to create a distinctively French style, proudly describing himself as 'Musicien Français'.

## Compositional Style

Debussy's musical style has an affinity with two other characteristically French genres - the *impressionist* painters (eg. Monet, Manet and Degas) and the *symbolist* writers (eg. Verlaine and Mallarmé). The label 'impressionist' is the one most commonly applied to Debussy's music (in spite of the fact that the composer himself objected to it).

# Piece

## Characteristics of the Piece

- Frequent use of 7th and 9th chords
- Parallel movement of chords
- Use of parallel 5ths in the bass
- Pedal points
- Rhythmic fluidity

## Debussy's Preludes for Piano

Debussy's *Préludes* (consisting of two books each containing twelve short pieces), were composed between 1909 and 1913. Unlike Chopin's *Préludes*, they follow not particular key sequence. Each *prélude* has a title, containing either a literary reference or a description of a scene, character or event. The titles are place at the end of each piece (not at the beginning as expected), almost as an afterthought; they are suggestions for the stimulation of the performer or audience, capturing a moment or an impression, rather than describing a full 'programme'.

## General Lavine - Excentric

*"General Lavine" - eccentric* is the sixth prelude in Book II. It is the style and tempo of a Cakewalk - a dance of African-American origin with syncopated rhythms and a ragtime (early jazz) style. *Golliwog's Cakewalk* and *Le petit Nègre* are other well known examples of cakewalks by Debussy. The title refers to the American comedian Edward Lavine, whose stage name was "General Lavine, the Eccentric". Debussy captures his stiff woodengait and his comical juggling antics.

The main key is F Major, and the form is Ternary ABA.

### Analysis

**Introduction**

1-10

> The strident flourish decorating a dominant pedal point is characteristic gesture of the General, and will return at various points throughout the piece, intruding on the cakewalk as a humorous interruption. The right hand has unrelated parallel triads, a typically impressionistic device.

**A**

11-22

 > The cakewalk proper, in F Major, through mostly pentatonic (F-G-A-C-D). The introductory motive makes an intrusion in (17-18).

23-34

> Cakewalk continues, with increasing chromaticism. (25-28) use Neapolitan and dominant 7th chords of G, without even fully settling in the new key. A dominant pedal in (31-34) returns the tonal centre to F.

35-45

> Cakewalk melody returns as in (11), but with new harmonisation in (39-42) using 7th chords. The introductory motive returns in (43-45) not based around the tonic rather than the dominant.

**B**

46-69

> Db Major. Begins with the parallel traids of the introduction, now legato and more lethargic compared withh before. There is a dominant pedal throughout much of this passage, interrupted by passages of unrelated parallel triads (51-54 and 63-64).

**A**

70-93

> A reprise of (11-34).

**Coda**

94-109

> A return of the cakewalk theme in Gb Major (the 'Neapolitan' key, 94-100), the parallel triads (101-102) and the introductory motive, concluding with a perfect cadence in F Major in (106-109)
