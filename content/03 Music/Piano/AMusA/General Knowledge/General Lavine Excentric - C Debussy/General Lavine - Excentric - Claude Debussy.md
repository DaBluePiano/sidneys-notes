# Composer

## Bio

Claude Debussy was born in France in 1862 and died there in 1918. He was one of the most significant figures in the development of 20th Century European music. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire, and also in Rome from 1885-1887 after winning the *Prix de Rome*. Visits to Bayreuth in 1888 and 1889 led to a brief intoxication with the music of Wagner (though this soon developed into an utter rejection of Wagner's approach to composition). Another significant influence at this time was hearing Javanese music in Paris.

## Contemporaries

The other great 'impressionist' composer was Maurice Ravel (1875-1937), who of course was also French. Other contemporaries of Debussy composing in very different styles include Puccini, Mahler, Bartók and Stravinsky.

## Compositions

Debussy's output includes the opera *Palléas et Mélisande*, orchestral music (including *Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune* and *La mer*), many songs, chamber and choral music, and much piano music (including *Images*, *Estampes*, *Children's Corner*, *Préludes* and *Etudes*, and *Fantasy* for piano and orchestra). In his music, he deliberately attempted to create a distinctively French style, proudly describing himself as 'Musicien Français'.

## Compositional Style

Debussy's musical style has an affinity with two other characteristically French genres - the *impressionist* painters (eg. Monet, Manet and Degas) and the *symbolist* writers (eg. Verlaine and Mallarmé). The label 'impressionist' is the one most commonly applied to Debussy's music (in spite of the fact that the composer himself objected to it). It is a very imprecise term; Oscar Thompson attempted to define it as applying to art which aims to 'suggest rather than depict... to interpret a fugitive impression rather than to seize upon and fix the permanent reality'. The visual artists of this school frequently explored the effects of light and water in their work, often resulting in a general haziness of outline; much of Debussy's music similarly has a vagueness n its harmony, rhythm and formal outline, and an interest in the sensuous aspect of sound. Symbolist poetry is subtle and suggestive, concise, and understated in its emotions and having a free and lyrical approach to meter. The opera *Palléas et Mélisande*, many songs and the titles of some piano pieces are based on the work of symbolist writers.

# Piece

## Debussy's Preludes for Piano

Debussy's *Préludes* (consisting of two books each containing twelve short pieces), were composed between 1909 and 1913. Unlike Chopin's *Préludes*, they follow not particular key sequence. Each *prélude* has a title, containing either a literary reference or a description of a scene, character or event. The titles are place at the end of each piece (not at the beginning as expected), almost as an afterthought; they are suggestions for the stimulation of the performer or audience, capturing a moment or an impression, rather than describing a full 'programme'.

## General Lavine - Excentric

*"General Lavine" - eccentric* is the sixth prelude in Book II. It is the style and tempo of a Cakewalk - a dance of African-American origin with syncopated rhythms and a ragtime (early jazz) style. *Golliwog's Cakewalk* and *Le petit Nègre* are other well known examples of cakewalks by Debussy. The title refers to the American comedian Edward Lavine, whose stage name was "General Lavine, the Eccentric". Debussy captures his stiff woodengait and his comical juggling antics.

The main key is F Major, and the form is Ternary ABA.

### Analysis

**Introduction**

1-10

> The strident flourish decorating a dominant pedal point is characteristic gesture of the General, and will return at various points throughout the piece, intruding on the cakewalk as a humorous interruption. The right hand has unrelated parallel triads, a typically impressionistic device.

**A**

11-22

> The cakewalk proper, in F Major, through mostly pentatonic (F-G-A-C-D). The introductory motive makes an intrusion in (17-18).

23-34

> Cakewalk continues, with increasing chromaticism. (25-28) use Neapolitan and dominant 7th chords of G, without even fully settling in the new key. A dominant pedal in (31-34) returns the tonal centre to F.

35-45

> Cakewalk melody returns as in (11), but with new harmonisation in (39-42) using 7th chords. The introductory motive returns in (43-45) not based around the tonic rather than the dominant.

**B**
46-69
> Db Major. Begins with the parallel traids of the introduction, now legato and more lethargic compared withh before. There is a dominant pedal throughout much of this passage, interrupted by passages of unrelated parallel triads (51-54 and 63-64).

**A**
70-93
> A reprise of (11-34).

**Coda**
94-109
> A return of the cakewalk theme in GB Major (the 'Neapolitan' key, 94-100), the parallel triads (101-102) and the introductory motive, concluding with a perfect cadence in F Major in (106-109)
