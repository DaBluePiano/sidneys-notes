# Piano

## Repertoire

### List A - Mozart Sonata in C K330

#SonataK330

#### 1st Movement

Much better trill

Maybe a tiny bit rushed

Overall shaping was good

Remember not to accent start of trills

Softer and slightly later last chord

#### 2nd Movement

That trill! - 1st time, not accurate

Remember - end of phrases more gentle

Second section - Dont rush and take care of tone of every note some unwanted accents were heard

#### 3rd Movement

Don't rush with nerves?

Some good saves

Lots of slow, careful practice

Gentle trills **138/9**

Bigger break here if need to feel new style and breathe

### List B - Bach Toccata in E BWV 914

#ToccataBWV914

#### 1st Movement

Excellent tonal control

Too long a break - maybe keep hands up

#### 2nd Movement

Strong and Secure

#### 3rd Movement

Excellent pacing and drama

#### 4th Movement

Be sure to practice LH slowly and carefully for clarity and coordination

Don't rush - keep very steady

**~120 and 136** drop

### List C - Mendelssohn Rondo Capriccioso Op 14

#RondoCapricciosoOp14

Some lack of confidence in introdction?

Presto - start softer

Tempo was very good

Excellent Drama, but enjoy the softer sections a little more

### List D - Debussy 'General Lavine' - Eccentric

#GeneralLavine-Eccentric

Very good storytelling - Here again - loud playing great - but enjoy the mischief of softer sections
