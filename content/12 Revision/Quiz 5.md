**Long Answer:** What are the three lines of defense that the body uses to fight against pathogens and explain each line. :: The three lines of defense are: 1. The first line of defense consists of physical barriers (skin, coughing, sneezing) and chemical barriers (saliva, tears, stomach acid) preventing the entry of pathogens. 2. The second line of defense includes non-specific immune responses such as inflammation, fever, and phagocytosis to eliminate pathogens that have entered the body.  3. The third line of defense (adaptive immunity) involves specialized white blood cells (lymphocytes) which recognize and remember specific pathogens, producing antibodies for targeted destruction.

c) Thomson

**Multiple Choice:** What did Rutherford's gold foil experiment conclude about the structure of an atom?
a) Atoms are mostly empty space with a small, dense, positively charged nucleus.
b) Atoms are solid and indivisible.
c) Atoms are composed of a mixture of positively and negatively charged particles.
d) Atoms contain a large, negatively charged nucleus surrounded by a cloud of positive charge.
?
a) Atoms are mostly empty space with a small, dense, positively charged nucleus.

**Short Answer:** Explain the difference between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. :: Nuclear fission is the splitting of a large nucleus into smaller nuclei, releasing energy, while nuclear fusion is the combining of two small nuclei to form a larger nucleus, also releasing energy.
