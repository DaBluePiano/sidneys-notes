a) Ball model
b) Plum pudding model
c) Planetary model
d) Nuclear model
?
b) Plum pudding model

**Long Answer:** Explain the difference between a chemical reaction and a physical reaction, providing an example of each. :: A chemical reaction involves the formation of new substances with different properties, such as burning wood (chemical reaction), while a physical reaction involves changes in physical state or appearance without forming new substances, such as melting ice (physical reaction).

**Fill in the Blank:** Fill in the blanks: The atomic number represents the number of `____`, while the atomic mass is the sum of `____` and `____`. :: protons, protons, neutrons

**Matching:** Match the type of nuclear reaction to its description:
Group A
a) Nuclear fission
b) Nuclear fusion
Group B
n) Small atoms combine to form larger atoms
o) Large atoms split into smaller atoms
?
a) -> o)
b) -> n)

**Select All That Apply:** Which of the following are isotopes of carbon?
a) Carbon-12
b) Carbon-13
c) Carbon-14
d) Carbon-15
e) Carbon-16
?
a) Carbon-12
b) Carbon-13
c) Carbon-14

**Short Answer:** Define the term 'half-life' in the context of radioactive decay and provide a sentence describing its significance. :: Half-life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay, which is important for determining the age of materials or predicting the duration of radioactivity.

**Multiple Choice:** Which scientist is credited with the discovery of the electron?
a) Democritus
b) Dalton
c) Thomson
d) Rutherford
?
c) Thomson

**Fill in the Blank:** The first electron shell can hold up to `____` electrons, while the second shell can hold up to `____` electrons. :: 2, 8

**Select All That Apply:** Select all the types of radiation that can be released during radioactive decay.
a) Alpha particles
b) Beta particles
c) Gamma rays
d) X-rays
e) Ultraviolet radiation
?
a) Alpha particles
b) Beta particles
c) Gamma rays

**Matching:** Match the scientist to their atomic model:
Group A
a) Democritus
b) Rutherford
c) Thomson
Group B
n) Plum pudding model
o) Nuclear model
p) Indivisible atom
?
a) -> p)
b) -> o)
c) -> n)

**Multiple Choice:** Which subatomic particle has a relative mass of approximately 1/1840 compared to a proton?
a) Proton
b) Electron
c) Neutron
d) Nucleus
?
b) Electron

**True or False:** Atoms are divisible and can be broken down into smaller particles. :: False

**Short Answer:** What are the three main groups of elements on the periodic table and provide a brief description of their properties? :: The three main groups of elements are metals (good conductors of heat and electricity), non-metals (poor conductors), and metalloids (properties of both metals and non-metals).

**True or False:** Electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed pathways called orbits, according to the Bohr model. :: True

**True or False:** Protons are negatively charged particles. :: False
