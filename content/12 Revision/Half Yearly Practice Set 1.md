> > c) High electronegativity

> [!question] Which subatomic particle determines the atomic number of an element?
> a) Proton
> b) Neutron
> c) Electron
> > [!success]- Answer
> > a) Proton

> [!question] The process by which two small nuclei combine to form a larger nucleus is called ____.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > nuclear fusion

> [!question] Protons are negatively charged particles found in the center of an atom.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > False

> [!question] Distinguish between a chemical reaction and a physical reaction, providing an example of each.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > A chemical reaction involves the formation of new substances with different properties, while a physical reaction involves a change in physical properties without forming new substances. For example, burning wood is a chemical reaction (producing ash and gases), while melting ice is a physical change (water changing state).

> > b) Proton
> > c) Neutron
>
> > [!example] Group B
> > n) Positive
> > o) Neutral
> > p) Negative
>
> > [!success]- Answer
> > a) -> p)
> > b) -> n)
> > c) -> o)

> [!question] Atoms are the smallest particles of matter that can be broken down into smaller particles.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > False

> [!question] Explain the difference between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > Nuclear fission is the splitting of a large atomic nucleus into smaller nuclei, releasing energy. Nuclear fusion is the combining of two small atomic nuclei to form a larger nucleus, also releasing energy.  Fission is used in nuclear power plants, while fusion powers the sun.

> [!question] What are the three lines of defense the body uses against pathogens, providing an example of each.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > The body's defenses include: 1st line - Physical and chemical barriers (skin, mucus, stomach acid), 2nd line - Non-specific internal defenses (inflammation, fever, phagocytosis), 3rd line - Adaptive or specific immunity (lymphocytes producing antibodies).

> [!question] Electrons are found in the ____ around the nucleus.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > electron cloud, shells, orbitals

> [!question] Electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed paths called shells.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > True

> [!question] Which model of the atom describes electrons orbiting the nucleus in specific energy levels?
> a) Dalton's model
> b) Thomson's model
> c) Rutherford's model
> d) Bohr's model
> > [!success]- Answer
> > d) Bohr's model

> [!question] Which scientist is credited with discovering the electron?
> a) Democritus
> b) Dalton
> c) Thomson
> d) Rutherford
> > [!success]- Answer
> > c) Thomson

> [!question] Which of the following scientists proposed that atoms are mostly empty space?
> a) Thomson
> b) Rutherford
> c) Bohr
> d) Chadwick
> > [!success]- Answer
> > b) Rutherford

> [!question] Define the terms 'epidemic', 'endemic', and 'pandemic'. Provide an example for each.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > 'Epidemic' refers to a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease in a community at a particular time (e.g., the 2014 Ebola outbreak). 'Endemic' describes a disease that is regularly found among particular people or in a certain area (e.g., malaria in some parts of Africa). 'Pandemic' is a disease that spreads over a whole country or the world (e.g., COVID-19).

> a) Fluorine
> b) Chlorine
> c) Bromine
> d) Iodine
> e) Oxygen
> > [!success]- Answer
> > a) Fluorine
> > b) Chlorine
> > c) Bromine
> > d) Iodine

> [!question] Match the scientist to their contribution to atomic theory:
> > [!example] Group A
> > a) Chadwick
> > b) Rutherford
> > c) Bohr
> > d) Thomson
> > e) Dalton
> > f) Democritus
>
> > [!example] Group B
> > n) Proposed the concept of indivisible particles
> > o) Proposed the nuclear model of the atom
> > p) Discovered the electron
> > q) Proposed the planetary model of the atom

> > d) -> p)
> > e) -> r)
> > f) -> n)

> [!question] The first electron shell can hold up to ____ electrons.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > 2

> [!question] The ____ is the positively charged central part of an atom, containing protons and neutrons.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > nucleus

> [!question] The second electron shell can hold up to 18 electrons.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > False

> [!question] Who discovered the neutron?
> a) Rutherford
> b) Bohr
> c) Chadwick
> d) Thomson
> > [!success]- Answer
> > c) Chadwick

> [!question] What are the factors that affect the rate of a chemical reaction?
> > [!success]- Answer
> > The factors affecting reaction rate include temperature (higher temp increases rate), concentration of reactants (higher concentration increases rate), surface area (increased surface area increases rate), agitation (stirring increases rate), and the presence of catalysts (catalysts speed up reactions).

> [!question] What model of the atom is associated with J.J. Thomson?
> a) Ball model
> b) Plum pudding model
> c) Planetary model
> d) Nuclear model
> > [!success]- Answer
> > b) Plum pudding model

> [!question] Describe the three main groups of elements on the periodic table and give examples of each.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > The three main groups are metals (e.g., iron, sodium, gold), nonmetals (e.g., oxygen, chlorine, carbon), and metalloids (e.g., silicon, boron, arsenic). Metals are generally good conductors of heat and electricity, while nonmetals are poor conductors. Metalloids have properties of both metals and nonmetals.
