> a) Double the root
> b) Double the third
> c) Double the fifth
> d) Avoid doubling notes
> > [!success]- Answer
> > a) Double the root
> > b) Double the third
> > c) Double the fifth

> [!question] Describe the rules and considerations for using passing notes and auxiliary notes in harmony, including how to avoid consecutive fifths and octaves.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > Passing notes are non-chord tones that smoothly connect two notes of a chord. Auxiliary notes are non-chord tones that briefly embellish a chord tone, moving a step away and returning.  When using passing and auxiliary notes, avoid creating consecutive fifths or octaves between voices by carefully considering the melodic movement in each voice part and ensuring contrary motion between at least some parts when moving between adjacent chords.  Make sure that passing notes and auxiliary notes don't create consecutive 5ths or 8ths and are carefully added.  In a minor key, be mindful of using the 6th and 7th degrees of the scale; always ensure the 7th is lowered when descending and raised when ascending.

> [!question] Explain the difference between a perfect cadence and an imperfect cadence.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > A perfect cadence is a strong and conclusive cadence that typically ends a musical piece, moving from the dominant chord (V) to the tonic chord (I). An imperfect cadence is a weaker cadence that doesn't provide the same sense of closure and is often found mid-piece, usually ending on the dominant chord (V)

> [!question] Match the following cadence types to their descriptions.
> > [!example] Group A
> > a) Imperfect Cadence
> > b) Interrupted Cadence
> > c) Perfect Cadence
> > d) Plagal Cadence
>
> > [!example] Group B
> > n) V → vi
> > o) I, II, IV or VI → V
> > p) IV → I
> > q) V → I
>
> > [!success]- Answer
> > a) -> o)
> > b) -> n)
> > c) -> q)
> > d) -> p)

> [!question] Consecutive fifths and octaves are allowed in harmony.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > False

> [!question] Which of the following cadences is used to end almost every musical composition?
> a) Imperfect Cadence
> b) Interrupted Cadence
> c) Perfect Cadence
> d) Plagal Cadence
> > [!success]- Answer
> > c) Perfect Cadence
