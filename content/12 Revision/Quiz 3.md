> > False

> [!question] Describe the process of simplifying an algebraic expression using index laws. Give an example.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > Simplifying algebraic expressions with index laws involves applying rules to combine terms with the same base.  For example, to simplify $x^3 \times x^2$, we add the exponents: $x^{3+2} = x^5$.

> > b) -> n)
> > c) -> o)

> [!question] What is a surd? Give three examples and explain how to simplify them.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > A surd is an irrational number that can be expressed as the root of a rational number. Examples: $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{12}$, $\sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}$.  $\sqrt{12}$ can be simplified to $2\sqrt{3}$ because $12 = 4 \times 3$. $\sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}$ simplifies to $\frac{2}{3}$
