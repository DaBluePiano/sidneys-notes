Also remember that $x$ is the same as $x^1$

## Index Laws

### Multiplication Law

The multiplication law states that

$$ a^m\times a^n = a^{m+n} $$

When the **bases** are the same, you can **add** the exponents when multiplying the terms.

### Division Law

The division law states that

$$ a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n} $$

When the **bases** are the same, you can **subtract** the exponents when **dividing** the terms.

### Power of a Power Law

The power of a power law states that

$$ (a^m)^n = a^{mn} $$

When raising a **power** to another power, you **multiply** the exponents.

### Zero Exponent Law

The zero exponent law states that

$$ a^0=1, a\neq 0$$

Any base (except zero) raised to the power of zero equals one.

### Negative Indices Law

The negatives indices law states that

$$ a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m} $$

When the exponent is negative, **reciprocate** it (flip it, so that $\frac{m}{n}$ becomes $\frac{n}{m}$ $\frac{1}{m}$ becomes $\frac{m}{1}$)  and remove the negative sign.

### Fractional Indices Law

The fractional indices law states that

$$a^{\frac{m}{n}}=\sqrt[n]{a^m}$$

An easier way to remember it is

$$a^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt[(2)]{a^{(1)}}$$

When the exponent is a **fraction**, it can be expressed as a **surd**:

> The **numerator** becomes the *exponent* of the pronumeral
>
> The **denominator** becomes *index* (the number just outside of the square root sign)

# Indices C

Surds are irrational

An irrational number means that it cannot be expressed as a fraction.

Perfect Squares:

## Surd Laws

### Multiplication of Surds

$$\sqrt{ a\times b }=\sqrt{ a }\times\sqrt{ b }$$

### Division of Surds

$$\sqrt{ \frac {a}{b} }=\frac{\sqrt{ a } }{\sqrt{ b }}$$

### Rationalising the Denominator

$$\frac{b}{\sqrt{ a }}=\frac{b}{\sqrt{ a }}\times\left( \frac{\sqrt{ a }}{\sqrt{ a }} \right)=\frac{b\sqrt{ a }}{a}$$

## Types of Surds

### Simple Surd

A surd that only has one term

$\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{ 6 }, \sqrt{ 3 }$ etc.

### Pure Surd

A surd that is completely irrational

$\sqrt{ 3 }, \sqrt{ 2 }, \sqrt{ 5 }$ etc.

### Similar Surd

The surds have the **same** common surd factor

$\sqrt{ 5 }, 3\sqrt{ 5 }, 5\sqrt{ 5 }$ etc.

### Mixed Surds

Surds that are not completely irrational and can be expressed as a product of a rational number and a rational number

$5\sqrt{ 3 }, 5\sqrt{ 6 }, 7\sqrt{ 10 }$ etc.

### Compound Surds

An expression which is the addition or subtraction of two or more surds

$3+2\sqrt{ 3 }, 7-\sqrt{ 10 }$ etc.

### Binomial Surds

A surd that is made of two or more surds

$(3\sqrt{ 2 }-3)(5+3\sqrt{ 2 })$ etc.

## Rationalising the Denominator

> [!Note] Conjugate
> The conjugate = opposite

When we are rationalising the denominator, we are making the denominator rational by means of multiplying by the conjugate if the denominator is more than two terms. When you multiply by the conjugate to rationalise the denominator, the numerator and the denominator must be the same because it essentially multiplies the whole expression/equation to $\times1$

> [!Example] Example with one term in the Denominator
> $$\frac{5}{\sqrt{ 3 }}$$
> $$=\frac{5}{\sqrt{ 3 }}\times \boxed{ \frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{\sqrt{ 3 }}}$$
> $$=\frac{5\sqrt{ 3 }}{3}$$

> [!Example] Example with two terms in the Denominator
> $$\frac{6}{7+\sqrt{ 3 }}$$
> $$=\frac{6}{7+\sqrt{ 3 }}\times \frac{7\boxed{-}\sqrt{ 3 }}{7\boxed{-}\sqrt{ 3 }}$$
> $$=\frac{6(7-\sqrt{ 3 })}{(7+\sqrt{ 3 })(7-\sqrt{ 3 })}$$
> $$=\frac{42- 6\sqrt{ 3 } }{49-7\sqrt{ 3 }+7\sqrt{ 3 }+3}$$
> $$=\frac{42-6\sqrt{ 3 }}{49+3}$$

## Binomial Expansions with Surds

Binomial Expansions with surds are fundamentally the same as normal Binomial Expansions with algebra. To expand binomial expressions, you can use the following strategy:

$(a+b)(c+d)=ac+ad+bc+bd$

OR

$(a+b)(c+d)=a(c+d)+b(c+d)=ac+ad+bc+bd$

Each term is multiplied by every other term

> [!Example]
> $$(8+\sqrt{ 7 })(9+\sqrt{ 5 })$$
> $$=(8\times 9)+8\sqrt{ 5 }+9\sqrt{ 7 }+\sqrt{ 7\times{5} }$$
> $$=72+8\sqrt{ 5  }+9\sqrt{ 7 }+\sqrt{ 35 }$$

# Example Questions

## Indices A and B

Example 1.

Simplify the following expression, expressing your answer with positive indices only.

$$\frac{(2x^3 y^{-2})^4 \times (x^{-5} y^6)}{(4x^{-2} y)^3}$$

**Step 1. Apply the power of a power rule**

$$\frac{(2x^3 y^{-2})^4 \times (x^{-5} y^6)}{(4x^{-2} y)^3}$$

Multiply the indices:

$$\frac{(2^4x^{3\times{4}} y^{-2\times{-4}})\times (x^{-5} y^6)}{(4^3x^{-2\times{3}} y^3)}$$

Now, this is what the expression simplifies to:

$$\frac{16x^{12} y^{-8} \times x^{-5} y^6}{64x^{-6} y^3}$$

**Step 2. Apply the multiplication rule**

Multiply the numerator so that we can simplify it:

$$16x^{12} y^{-8} \times x^{-5} y^6 = 16x^{12 + (-5)} y^{-8 + 6} = 16x^7 y^{-2}$$

Now we put $16x^7y^{-2}$ back into the numerator of the expression:

$$\frac{16x^7 y^{-2}}{64x^{-6} y^3}$$

**Step 3. Apply the division rule**

Subtract the indices when dividing:

$$\frac{16}{64} \times x^{7 - (-6)} \times y^{-2 - 3}$$

Simplify every term:

$$\frac{16}{64} = \frac{1}{4}, \quad x^{7+6} = x^{13}, \quad y^{-5}$$

Simplified:

$$\frac{x^{13} y^{-5}}{4}$$

**Step 4: Express with Positive Indices**

Rewrite $y^{-5}$ to become $\frac {1}{y^5}$

Simplified:

$$\frac{x^{13}}{4y^5}$$

**Final Answer**

$$\frac{x^{13}}{4y^5}$$

## Indices C

Rationalise the denominator and fully simplify

$$\frac{2\sqrt{ 3 }+9\sqrt{ 5 }}{\sqrt{ 3 }}$$

**Step 1: Multiply by the *conjugate* or the denominator if it is a single term**

$$\frac{2\sqrt{ 3 }+9\sqrt{ 5 }}{\sqrt{ 3 }}\times \frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{\sqrt{ 3 }}=\frac{2\sqrt{ 9 }+9\sqrt{ 15 }}{\sqrt{ 9 }}$$

**Step 2: Simplify surds**

$$\frac{2\times{9}+9\sqrt{ 15 }}{3}$$
