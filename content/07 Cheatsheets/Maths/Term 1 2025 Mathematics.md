> (eg. $9xy^2$ and $15xy^2$ are like terms because they have the same two bases and exponent, $xy^2$)

Also remember that $x$ is the same as $x^1$

## Index Laws

### Multiplication Law

The multiplication law states that

$$ a^m\times a^n = a^{m+n} $$

When the **bases** are the same, you can **add** the exponents when multiplying the terms.

### Division Law

The division law states that

$$ a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n} $$

When the **bases** are the same, you can **subtract** the exponents when **dividing** the terms.

### Power of a Power Law

The power of a power law states that

$$ (a^m)^n = a^{mn} $$

When raising a **power** to another power, you **multiply** the exponents.

### Zero Exponent Law

The zero exponent law states that

$$ a^0=1, a\neq 0$$

Any base (except zero) raised to the power of zero equals one.

### Negative Indices Law

The negatives indices law states that

$$ a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m} $$

When the exponent is negative, **reciprocate** it (flip it, so that $\frac{m}{n}$ becomes $\frac{n}{m}$ $\frac{1}{m}$ becomes $\frac{m}{1}$)  and remove the negative sign.

### Fractional Indices Law

The fractional indices law states that

$$a^{\frac{m}{n}}=\sqrt[n]{a^m}$$

An easier way to remember it is

$$a^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt[(2)]{a^{(1)}}$$

When the exponent is a **fraction**, it can be expressed as a **surd**:

> The **numerator** becomes the *exponent* of the pronumeral
> The **denominator** becomes *index* (the number just outside of the square root sign)
