## Index Laws

### Multiplication Law

The multiplication law states that

$$ a^m\times a^n = a^{m+n} $$

When the **bases** are the same, you can **add** the exponents when multiplying the terms.

### Division Law

The division law states that

$$ a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n} $$

When the **bases** are the same, you can **subtract** the exponents when **dividing** the terms.

### Power of a Power Law

The power of a power law states that

$$ (a^m)^n = a^{mn} $$

When raising a **power** to another power, you **multiply** the exponents.

### Zero Exponent Law

The zero exponent law states that

$$ a^0=1, a\neq 0$$

Any base (except zero) raised to the power of zero equals one.

### Negative Indices Law

The negatives indices law states that

$$ a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m} $$

When the exponent is negative, **reciprocate** it (flip it, so that $\frac{m}{n}$ becomes $\frac{n}{m}$ $\frac{1}{m}$ becomes $\frac{m}{1}$)  and remove the negative sign.

### Fractional Indices Law

The fractional indices law states that

$$a^{\frac{m}{n}}=\sqrt[n]{a^m}$$

An easier way to remember it is

$$a^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt[(2)]{a^{(1)}}$$

When the exponent is a **fraction**, it can be expressed as a **surd**:

> The **numerator** becomes the *exponent* of the pronumeral
>
> The **denominator** becomes *index* (the number just outside of the square root sign)

# Indices C

Surds are irrational

An irrational number means that it cannot be expressed as a fraction.

Perfect Squares:

## Surd Laws

### Multiplication of Surds

$$\sqrt{ a\times b }=\sqrt{ a }\times\sqrt{ b }$$

### Division of Surds

$$\sqrt{ \frac {a}{b} }=\frac{\sqrt{ a } }{\sqrt{ b }}$$

### Rationalising the Denominator
$$\frac{b}{\sqrt{ a }}=\frac{b}{\sqrt{ a }}\times\left( \frac{\sqrt{ a }}{\sqrt{ a }} \right)=\frac{b\sqrt{ a }}{a}$$

## Types of Surds

### Simple Surd

A surd that only has one term

$\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{ 6 }, \sqrt{ 3 }$ etc.

### Pure Surd

A surd that is completely irrational

$\sqrt{ 3 }, \sqrt{ 2 }, \sqrt{ 5 }$ etc.

### Similar Surd

The surds have the **same** common surd factor

$\sqrt{ 5 }, 3\sqrt{ 5 }, 5\sqrt{ 5 }$ etc.

### Mixed Surds

Surds that are not completely irrational and can be expressed as a product of a rational number and a rational number

$5\sqrt{ 3 }, 5\sqrt{ 6 }, 7\sqrt{ 10 }$ etc.

### Compound Surds

An expression which is the addition or subtraction of two or more surds

$3+2\sqrt{ 3 }, 7-\sqrt{ 10 }$ etc.

### Binomial Surds

A surd that is made of two or more surds

$(3\sqrt{ 2 }-3)(5+3\sqrt{ 2 })$ etc.

# Example Questions
## Indices A and B
Example 1. 
Simplify the following expression, expressing your answer with positive indices only.
$$\frac{(2x^3 y^{-2})^4 \times (x^{-5} y^6)}{(4x^{-2} y)^3}$$
**Step 1. Apply the power of a power rule**
$$\frac{(2x^3 y^{-2})^4 \times (x^{-5} y^6)}{(4x^{-2} y)^3}$$
Multiply the indices:
$$\frac{(2^4x^{3\times{4}} y^{-2\times{-4}})\times (x^{-5} y^6)}{(4^3x^{-2\times{3}} y^3)}$$
Now, this is what the expression simplifies to:
$$\frac{16x^{12} y^{-8} \times x^{-5} y^6}{64x^{-6} y^3}$$
**Step 2. Apply the multiplication rule**
Multiply the numerator so that we can simplify it:
$$16x^{12} y^{-8} \times x^{-5} y^6 = 16x^{12 + (-5)} y^{-8 + 6} = 16x^7 y^{-2}$$
Now we put $16x^7y^{-2}$ back into the numerator of the expression:
$$\frac{16x^7 y^{-2}}{64x^{-6} y^3}$$
**Step 3. Apply the division rule**
Subtract the indices when dividing:
$$\frac{16}{64} \times x^{7 - (-6)} \times y^{-2 - 3}$$
Simplify every term:
$$\frac{16}{64} = \frac{1}{4}, \quad x^{7+6} = x^{13}, \quad y^{-5}$$
Simplified:
$$\frac{x^{13} y^{-5}}{4}$$
**Step 4: Express with Positive Indices**
Rewrite $y^{-5}$ to become $\frac {1}{y^5}$
Simplified:
$$\frac{x^{13}}{4y^5}$$
**Final Answer**
$$\frac{x^{13}}{4y^5}$$
