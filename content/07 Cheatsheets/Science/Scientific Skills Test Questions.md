> a) Quantitative
> b) Qualitative
> c) Discrete
> d) Continuous
> > [!success]- Answer
> > c) Discrete

> [!question] Explain the difference between an independent and dependent variable in an experiment.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > An independent variable is the variable that is manipulated or changed by the researcher, while the dependent variable is the variable that is measured or observed to see how it is affected by the changes in the independent variable.  The independent variable is the cause, and the dependent variable is the effect.

> [!question] Describe the difference between discrete and continuous data, and give examples of each.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > Discrete data consists of distinct, separate values that are countable (e.g., number of students, number of cars). Continuous data can take on any value within a range and is measurable (e.g., height, weight, temperature).

> [!question] Qualitative data can be easily analyzed using mathematical operations.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > False

> [!question] Which of the following are examples of discrete data?
> a) Height
> b) Weight
> c) Number of books
> d) Temperature
> e) Time
> f) Number of students
> > [!success]- Answer
> > c) Number of books
> > f) Number of students

> [!question] Discrete data can always be divided into smaller parts.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > False

> [!question] Which of the following are examples of qualitative data?
> a) Height
> b) Weight
> c) Color
> d) Temperature
> e) Smell
> f) Number of cars
> > [!success]- Answer
> > c) Color
> > e) Smell

> [!question] The variable being observed or measured is the `____` variable, while the variable being changed is the `____` variable.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > dependent, independent

> [!question] Data that answers 'how many' or 'how much' is `____` data, while data that answers 'what type' or 'what category' is `____` data.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > quantitative, qualitative

> [!question] Quantitative data is descriptive and non-numerical.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > False

> [!question] Which of the following are examples of continuous data?
> a) Number of students
> b) Number of cars
> c) Height
> d) Weight
> e) Temperature
> > [!success]- Answer
> > c) Height
> > d) Weight
> > e) Temperature

> [!question] What are the key differences between quantitative and qualitative data? Provide examples of each.
> > [!success]- Answer
> > Quantitative data is numerical and measurable, often answering 'how many' or 'how much' (e.g., height, weight, temperature). Qualitative data is descriptive and non-numerical, often answering 'what type' or 'what category' (e.g., color, texture, smell).
