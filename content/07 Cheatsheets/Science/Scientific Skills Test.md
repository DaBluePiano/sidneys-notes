# Different Types of Variables

## Independent Variable

- The variable being changed
- Changing it causes an effect on the dependent variable

## Dependent Variable

- The variable being observed or measured
- The variable that changes when the independent variable is changed
- Provides data for the experiment

## Controlled Variable

- All other variables in the experiment besides the independent and dependent variables
- What you keep the same (the things that do not change)
