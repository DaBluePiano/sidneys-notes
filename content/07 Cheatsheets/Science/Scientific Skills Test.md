# Different Types of Variables

## Independent Variable

- The variable being changed
- Changing it causes an effect on the dependent variable

## Dependent Variable

- The variable being observed or measured
- The variable that changes when the independent variable is changed
- Provides data for the experiment

## Controlled Variable

- All other variables in the experiment besides the independent and dependent variables
- What you keep the same (the things that do not change)

# Types of Data

## Quantitative Data

Quantitative data is numerical and can be measured. It allows for mathematical operations and statistical analysis. This type of data often answers questions like "how many" or "how much." Examples include height, weight, temperature, and the number of students in a class.

## Qualitative Data

Qualitative data is descriptive and non-numerical. It focuses on the characteristics, properties, and attributes of something. This type of data often answers questions like "what type" or "what category." Examples include colors, textures, smells, and opinions.

## Discrete Data

Discrete data consists of distinct, separate values. It is countable and often involves whole numbers. This type of data can't be divided into smaller parts. Examples include the number of books on a shelf, the number of students in a classroom, and the number of cars in a parking lot.

## Continuous Data

Continuous data consists of values that can take on any value within a range. It is measurable and can be divided into smaller parts. This type of data often involves decimals and fractions. Examples include height, weight, time, and temperature.

# Variable

## Independent Variables

Independent variables are the ones that are manipulated or controlled in an experiment. They are considered the "cause" in a cause-and-effect relationship. Researchers change independent variables to observe how they affect other variables. For example, if you're studying the effect of different fertilizers on plant growth, the type of fertilizer would be the independent variable.

## Dependent Variables

Dependent variables are the ones that are measured or observed in an experiment. They are considered the "effect" in a cause-and-effect relationship. The dependent variable's changes are dependent on the manipulation of the independent variable. In the same example of studying the effect of different fertilizers on plant growth, the plant growth would be the dependent variable.

## The Difference Between Them

The primary difference between independent and dependent variables lies in their roles within an experiment. The independent variable is the one that is changed or controlled by the experimenter, while the dependent variable is the one that is measured or observed to see how it is affected by the changes in the independent variable. In other words:

- **Independent Variable:** The cause or input that is manipulated.

- **Dependent Variable:** The effect or output that is measured.
