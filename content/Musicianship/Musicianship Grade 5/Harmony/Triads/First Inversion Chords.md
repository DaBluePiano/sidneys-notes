title: First Inversion Chords
---
A first inversion chord is composed by placing the **root** of the chord in an upper voice and the 3rd of the root position chord then becomes the **bass** note. 

CEGC chord becomes ~~C~~EGCC - the root 'crossed out' and placed on the other side. This chord in harmony is called the 'chord of the <sup>6</sup><sub>3</sub>' which is simple to understand. The *new* chord created is:

<center>E  G  C  C</center>

<center>from E to C is a 6th and from E to G is a 3rd, hence the name <sup>6</sup><sub>3</sub>.
</center>

There are 2 possibilities of doubling in a first inversion chord - the 6th may be doubled (the 6th is the original root) and the 3rd may be doubled (the 3rd is the original 5th). 

> [!Caution] 
> DON'T DOUBLE the new bass note (which is the original 3rd)

Two possible chords:
a) 
<center>E  G  C  C</center>
<center>6th doubled (C)</center>
b) 
<center>E  G  C  G</center>
<center>3rd doubled (G)</center>

Each primary and Secondary Triad is available in first inversion. The letter *b* denotes a first inversion chord.

> [!Important] 
> These first inversion chords are also available in minor keys. Don't forget to raise LN every time it appears (in Vb and VIIb)

Quite often in Harmony, two or more first inversion chords may appear next to each other. The 6th must be doubled in one chord and the 3rd double in the next chord (done to avoid consecutives). Ib-IIb is commonly used.
