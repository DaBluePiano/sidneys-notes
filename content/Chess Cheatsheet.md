# Principles divided by phase

1. Opening

- Control the Center
- Develop your pieces:
	_i. Towards the center_
	_ii. Where they have the most mobility_
	_iii. Knights and bishops should come out before queens and rooks_
	_iv. Usually you want to develop the knight and bishop on the side you want to castle before the other pieces, so you can get castled quickly. Try and make sure that none of your knights or bishops are still on their starting squares after 10 moves._

- Protect your King: castle early
- Don’t bring your queen out too early
- Don’t move the same piece twice (unless it helps capture an enemy piece)
- Clear the back rank and connect your rooks
- Placing a rook opposite the enemy queen is sometimes also a good idea, even if there are currently pieces in the way.
- Good Development Example:

2. Middle Game

- **Centralize your pieces**
- **Trade flank pawns for the central pawns**
- **Avoid pawn weaknesses** (doubled, backward, and isolated)
- **Avoid weak squares***
- Always blockade your opponent’s isolated pawn with a knight
- Occupy open files with your rooks (and also double the rooks)
- Keep the bishop pair
- Exchange pieces when it helps your defense: if you exchange the blocking pieces with enemy pieces (as long as the exchange is balanced) you free your blocked-in pieces and remove a few potential enemy attackers from the fight.
- **Exchange material to relieve positional pressure:** when enemy pieces are putting your position under pressure, exchange material to relieve that pressure

3. Endgame

- Usually a position can be viewed as **an endgame position when it is safe for the king to join the other active pieces**.
- Cut the enemy king off from the action when you can.
- **Rooks should be placed behind passed pawns*** — your pawns or your opponent’s pawns.
- **Attack your opponents weak pawns** to **force your opponent’s pieces into defensive positions**.
- Place your pieces on squares where they **restrict the mobility of your opponents pieces**.
- If you have a material advantage, it is good to exchange pieces but keep pawns. Exchanging pawns increases your opponent’s drawing chances. The less pieces there are on the board, the more important the pawns become.
- If you have an advantage, you should leave pawns on both sides of the board so that your opponent will be forced to defend on both sides of the board.
- If you have one bishop, put your pawns on the opposite color squares — this way you can control squares with your pawns which the bishop can’t control.
- Bishops on opposite color squares tend to often lead to a draw even when one player has an extra pawn or two.
- 3 main goals (tasks) that you should always keep in mind for the endgame:

i. Get your king into an active position.

a. The attacking value of a king is surprisingly high. Unfortunately, the king can mostly not be used as an attacking piece since he is a vulnerable target. However, **when the opponent does not have enough pieces to actively attack the king, it becomes possible to use the king as an attacking piece**. Activating the king to the best square is essential to improve your position for the endgame. The attacking value of the king can even be slightly more than that of the knight or bishop. _The estimated point value of the king is about 4 points — more than a knight or bishop, but less than a rook_. Certainly the value of all pieces depends on other factors in the position but the fact remains that **it is essential for the king to help the remaining pieces and pawns during the endgame**.

**b. Example:** Material is even, but white wins easily because his king is active.

ii. Create a passed pawn.

a. Promoting a pawn to a new queen in the endgame usually leads to your opponent resigning the game. **Even if a passed pawn can not immediately be promoted, it can often tie down an enemy piece which needs to keep watch and prevent the passed pawn from slipping through**. This means that your opponent often has to play on other parts of the board with one less piece and can give you the opportunity to create another weakness to exploit. **Often the opponent needs to sacrifice a piece in order to prevent promotion of a passed pawn**. Playing with an extra piece in the endgame is usually an easy win for the player with the extra piece.

**b. Example:** Black wins by playing 1…. Bxc3.

**Example:** Black wins by playing 1…. Bxc3.

iii. Dominate the activity of the opponents pieces.

1. **Restricting or dominating the mobility of the enemy pieces is important in the middle-game as well as during the endgame**. In the endgame there are only a few remaining pieces, if any — this means that every piece should play an important role since there are not many other supporting pieces in the endgame. If you can restrict the mobility of your opponent’s pieces it can bring you an advantage and the chance to see if you can convert your more active position into a more concrete winning chance.
2. **Example** — Black will have serious difficulty to activate his knight — which may give white the opportunity to dominate the action on the king-side of the board.

**Example** — Black will have serious difficulty to activate his knight — which may give white the opportunity to dominate the action on the king-side of the board.

# Principles divided by piece

Pawn

1. Avoid pawn weaknesses (doubled, backward, and isolated)
2. Use pawns to avoid weak squares*
3. Always blockade your opponent’s isolated pawn with a knight
4. Make pawn moves that open up lines for your pieces after developing in the opening.
5. **Pawn storm:** when a player moves connected pawns multiple times in rapid succession to attack the opponent. A well-executed pawn storm can open lines for an attack on the king. It can also lead to immediate material gain or a decisive strategic advantage. Not only that, but it is a typical plan of widely used openings, such as the King’s Indian and Sicilian Defenses, the Benoni, and others.
6. Advance your good pawns to increase your chances of creating a passed pawn.
7. If you have a material advantage, it is good to exchange pieces but keep pawns. Exchanging pawns increases your opponent’s drawing chances. The less pieces there are on the board, the more important the pawns become.
8. If you have an advantage, you should leave pawns on both sides of the board so that your opponent will be forced to defend on both sides of the board.
9. Passed pawns on the edge of the board is a key advantage since you can use it to distract your opponent’s pieces (or king) away from other targets.
10. Attack a pinned piece with a pawn

Knight

1. Always blockade your opponent’s isolated pawn with a knight
2. In closed positions*, the knight is more powerful than the bishop because of its ability to jump over pawns and pieces.
3. A bishop is usually slightly better than a knight when the action is on both sides of the board. However, when the pawns are only on one side of the board, the knight can be more useful since it can reach both the light and dark squares.

Bishop

1. **Keep the bishop pair:** Avoid giving up one of your bishops in the opening or early middle-game just to create doubled pawns in your opponent’s pawn structure. In most cases, the attacking potential of the bishop pair outweigh the pawn structure defects.
2. In open positions*, with diagonals void of pawns and pieces, the bishop should be used over the knight.
3. Long distance pieces that need mobility to be useful during the game.
4. If you have one bishop, put your pawns on the opposite color squares — this way you can control squares with your pawns which the bishop can’t control.
5. Bishops on opposite color squares tend to often lead to a draw even when one player has an extra pawn or two.

Rook

1. Occupy open files with your rooks
2. If there is an open file (no pieces or pawns on the straight line) available, your instinctual move should be to occupy the file with your rook. **The next step should be to double your rooks on the open file**. If there are no open files available, you can occupy a semi-open file that you can force open later.
3. Rooks should be placed behind passed pawns* — your pawns or your opponent’s pawns.

Queen

1. **Best role is attacking**. Her ability to strike out along ranks, files and diagonals gives her an unparalleled ability to create multiple threats at once and overload enemy defenses singlehanded.
2. **Poor defender:** Because of the queen’s value, simply being protected by another piece is often not enough — when attacked by an enemy piece of lesser value (and aside from the enemy queen they are all of lesser value) she is usually compelled to move and abandon whatever defensive duties she was performing.
3. An attack on the queen is almost like a check, because the opponent will almost always have to save their queen. You can often use an attack on an exposed queen to gain time to move your piece to a better square.
4. Check to see if your Queen is being attacked after every move.
5. **Don’t bring out the queen early**- it will give your opponents an easy target
6. **Queens work best on open files and open diagonals**, similar to Rooks and Bishops.
7. **Queens work best when coordinating an attack with other pieces**.
8. **Don’t send your Queen into the opponent’s end of the board without support**.
9. If your opponent brings his/her queen out early, attack it.

King

1. King safety and mobility come first
2. Castle early
3. Avoid moving the pawns in front of your king (after castling)

# *Concepts (batteries, forks, safe squares etc.)

- **Battery:** a configuration of heavy pieces (rooks or queens) that occupy the same file. It can also refer to long-range pieces (queens and bishops) that occupy the same diagonal.
- **Discovered attack:** a direct attack revealed when one piece moves out of the way of another.
- **Skewer**: an attack upon two pieces in a line and is similar to a pin. A skewer is the opposite of a pin; the difference is that in a skewer, the more valuable piece is the one under direct attack and the less valuable piece is behind it.
- **Fork:** single piece attacking two or more pieces at the same time.
- **Weak square:** square that cannot be protected by a pawn
- **Passed pawn:** a pawn with no opposing pawns to prevent it from advancing to the eighth rank ; i.e. there are no opposing pawns in front of it on either the same file or adjacent files. A passed pawn is sometimes colloquially called a passer.
- Three Types of Positions:

1. **Closed position:** a position with a locked pawn center and typically very few (if any) pawns have been traded.

i. Closed position plans involve a lot of pawn breaks and maneuvers. One option is pushing pawns and trading them in order to open files and give your pieces more freedom to move. You can also try to trade off your bad pieces for your opponent’s good pieces.

ii. You can use your time effectively by slowly improving your position and placing your pieces on their best squares, followed by an eventual breakthrough or attack on your opponent’s king.

**2. Semi-Open position:** a position with very few or no locked pawns and typically 1 or 2 pawns may have been traded. Most play in semi-open positions will revolve around pieces and pawns in combination with each other.

**3. Open position:** a position with no locked pawns and typically 3 or more pawns have been traded. The vast majority of play in open positions will involve pieces with a lot less emphasis on pawns because they are in less supply. These types of positions are usually full of tactical ideas because piece movement is at its highest at this point. Bishops are very valuable because their diagonals are wide open to be used effectively. There are less pawns on the board to block the pieces which allows them to move much more freely.

# Checkmate types (smother checkmate, en passant checkmate, etc.)

- **smother checkmate:** a checkmate delivered by a knight in which the mated king is unable to move because it is completely surrounded (or smothered) by its own pieces.
- **en passant checkmate:** checkmate caused by an en passant

# Mental Conditioning

**Lifestyle:** Adequate sleep, regular exercise, meditation, reading, no drugs or alcohol.

**Training:** puzzles, visualization, meditation

**Decision-making:**

- **pay attention to what your opponent is tryin**g to do each turn
- **Repair weaknesses before attacking**. However, don’t defend a weak point if it ruins your game (**there are times when you simply cannot defend a weak point in your position**).
- **Be aware of counterattacks**- always examine your opponent’s position for possible counterattacks before launching your own attack
- Am I permitting my opponent to reveal an attack on a piece? (example below):

**QA Checklist Before Making Every Move:**

- “Will I give up material after my opponent’s turn if I do this…” [if yes, is it worth it?
- Look for forcing moves: Checks, captures, threats.

**Mistakes to address/review:**

- smith mora
- Queen’s Gambit Declined; Albin, Lasker Trap
- Fried Liver Attack
